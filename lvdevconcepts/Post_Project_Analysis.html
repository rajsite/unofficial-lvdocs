<p class="Body">
         At the end of each stage in the development process, consider having a post-project analysis meeting to discuss what went well and what did not. Each developer must evaluate the project honestly and discuss obstacles that reduced the quality level of the project. Consider the following questions during a post-project analysis meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we doing right? What works well?</li>
<li>What are we doing wrong? What can we improve?</li>
<li>Are there specific areas of the design or code that need work? Is a design review or code review of that section necessary?</li>
<li>Are the quality systems working? Can we catch more problems if we change the quality requirements? Are there better ways to get the same results?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Post-project analysis meetings at major milestones can help to correct problems mid-schedule instead of waiting until the end of the release cycle.</p>
