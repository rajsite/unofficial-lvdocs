<p class="Body">
   
   Organizing the documentation systematically helps users learn about the product, VI, or application. Different users have different documentation needs. End users of VIs fall into the following two classes�end users of top-level VIs and end users of subVIs. Each of these users has different documentation needs.  This topic addresses techniques for creating and organizing documentation that helps both of these classes of users. The format of user documentation depends on the type of product you create.</p><a name="Systematically_Organizing_Documentation"></a><h2>Systematically Organizing Documentation </h2>
<p class="Body">
 To make documentation more helpful for the user, consider organizing the documentation in a systematic way. Divide the documentation into three categories�concepts, procedures, and reference material. Create documentation that reflects these three categories.</p><a name="Documenting_a_Library_of_VIs"></a><h2>Documenting a Library of VIs </h2>
<p class="Body">
  If the software you are creating is a library of VIs for use by other developers, such as an instrument driver or add-on package, create documents with a format similar to the <em>LabVIEW Help</em>. Because the audience is other developers, assume the audience has a working knowledge of LabVIEW. Create documentation that contains an overview of the contents of the package, examples of how to use the subVIs, and a detailed description of each subVI.</p>
<p class="Body">For each subVI, include information such as the VI name and description, a picture of the connector pane, and a picture of the data type description for each control and indicator on the connector pane.</p>
<p class="Body">To generate most of the <a href="Describing.html">documentation for VIs and controls</a>, select <strong>File�VI Properties</strong> and select <strong>Documentation</strong> from the <strong>Category</strong> pull-down menu.</p>
<p class="Body">Select <strong>File�Print</strong> to print VI documentation in a format almost identical to the format used in the VI and function reference information in the <em>LabVIEW Help</em>. Use the <a href="../lvdialog/Custom_Print_Settings.html">Print</a> dialog box to save the documentation to a file and to create documentation for multiple VIs at once.</p><a name="Documenting_an_Application"></a><h2>Documenting an Application </h2>
<p class="Body">
  If you are developing an application for users who are unfamiliar with LabVIEW, the documentation requires more introductory material. Create a document that provides system requirements, basic installation instructions, and an overview about how the package works. If the package uses I/O, include hardware requirements and any configuration instructions the user must complete before using the application.</p>
<p class="Body">For each front panel with which the user interacts, provide a picture of the front panel and a description of the major controls and indicators. Organize the front panel descriptions in a top-down fashion, with the front panel the user sees first documented first. You also can use the <a href="../lvdialog/Custom_Print_Settings.html">Print</a> dialog box to create this documentation.</p>
