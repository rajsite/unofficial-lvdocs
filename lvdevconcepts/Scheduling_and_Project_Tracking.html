<p class="Body">
  This book describes techniques for <a href="Estimation.html">estimating development time</a> and using those estimates to <a href="Mapping_Estimates_to_Schedules.html">create schedules</a>. This book also distinguishes between an estimate, which reflects the time required to implement a feature, and a schedule, which reflects how you fulfill that feature. Estimates are commonly expressed in eight-hour work days. When creating schedules from estimates, consider dependencies such as the completion of a project before another can begin. Also consider daily tasks that take away from project time, such as meetings, support for existing projects, and so on.</p>
