   When you first begin a programming project, deciding how to start can be intimidating. Many LabVIEW developers start immediately with a <a href="Lifecycle_Models.html#Code_and_Fix_Model">code and fix</a> development process, building some of the VIs they think are needed, only to realize they actually need something different from what they have built already. Consequently, people unnecessarily develop, rework, or discard code. Developers can save time and effort when they use detailed designs with clearly defined goals, such as <a href="../lvdevconcepts/Top_Down_Design.html">top-down design</a>, to develop large applications.</p>
