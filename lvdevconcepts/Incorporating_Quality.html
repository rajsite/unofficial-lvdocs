<p class="Body">
         
         Many developers who follow the <a href="Lifecycle_Models.html#Code_and_Fix_Model">code and fix programming style</a> mistakenly believe quality is not an issue until the testing phase. Developers must design quality into a product from the start. Developing quality software begins by selecting a development model that helps you avoid problems from the beginning. Consider quality during all stages of developmentï¿½requirements and specifications, design, coding, testing, release, and maintenance.</p>
<p class="Body">Do not regard quality controls as tedious requirements that impede development. Most quality controls streamline development so you discover the problems before they are in the software, when it is inexpensive to fix them.</p>
