<p class="Body">This book describes design issues that might arise when you develop a large application and provides guidelines that you can use to address these issues. For instance, it is difficult to maintain a large LabVIEW application when the block diagram difficult to read. When you follow the guidelines and create block diagrams with explanatory comments and proper data flow, you ensure that the application is easily maintainable. </p>
<p class="Body">All guidelines are based on the advice of LabVIEW developers and provide a basic survey of software engineering techniques you might find useful when you develop an application.</p>
<p class="Body">This book also includes a style checklist to follow when creating VIs.  You can use the checklist and the LabVIEW Development Guidelines to create and maintain a consistent style throughout different LabVIEW projects.</p>
