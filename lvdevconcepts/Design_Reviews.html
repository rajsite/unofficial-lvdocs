<p class="Body">
         Design reviews are a great way to identify and fix problems during development. When you complete the design of a feature, set up a design review with at least one other developer. Discuss quality goals and consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the design incorporate testing?</li>
<li>Is error handling built-in?</li>
<li>Are there any assumptions in the system that might be invalid?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Look at the design for features that are essential as opposed to features that are extras. Extra features are okay, but if quality and schedule are important, schedule these extra features for later in the development process. This way you can drop or move the list of extra features to subsequent releases if time becomes a constraining factor. Document the results of the design review and any recommended changes.</p>
