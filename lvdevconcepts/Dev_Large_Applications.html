     LabVIEW makes it easy to assemble components of data acquisition, test, and control systems. Because creating applications in LabVIEW is so easy, many people begin to develop VIs immediately with little planning or design considerations. For simple applications, such as quick lab tests or monitoring applications, this approach can be appropriate. However, larger applications require more planning and development.</p>
