<h1>A subVI which claims to be part of a dependent packed library is missing from that packed library</h1>
<p class="Body">LabVIEW cannot find a subVI of this VI. The subVI claims to be owned by the packed library in memory, but the packed library does not contain the subVI.</p>
<p class="Body">The packed library might have been rebuilt without the subVI, or the subVI might be a member of a different packed library with the same name. If you open a different packed library with the same name, all VIs link to the open packed library.</p>
