<h1>You have attempted to connect a wire to a floating object</h1>
<p class="Body">You have attempted to connect a wire to a floating object, which LabVIEW does not allow. You might encounter this error when expanding a structure, such as a while loop, around an object on the block diagram. Floating objects have a shadow around their border that signifies that they are not actually inside the structure, but floating above it.</p>

<p class="Body">To correct this error, click and drag the floating object outside of the structure. The shadow disappears and you can drag the object back to its previous position inside the structure.</p>
