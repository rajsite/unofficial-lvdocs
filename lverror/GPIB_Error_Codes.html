<p class="Body">The <a href="../lvinstio/Tradit_GPIB_Func_Descr.html">GPIB</a> functions and VI Server properties and methods can return the following error codes. Refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_KB)">KnowledgeBase</a> for more information about correcting errors in LabVIEW.</p>
<table class="Bordered">
<tr>
<th class="Bordered">Code</th>
<th class="Bordered">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">0</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Error connecting to driver or device. The NI-488.2 driver may not be installed. This error might be caused by a failure to find or properly open the GPIB device driver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">1</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Command requires GPIB Controller to be Controller-In-Charge. This error occurs when the board is not the Controller-In-Charge and any board-level function requiring controller capability is called or when any device-level function that affects the GPIB is called and the driver cannot make the board the Controller-In-Charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">2</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">No Listeners on the GPIB. This error occurs when a data-byte write operation, such as <span class="Monospace">ibwrt</span>, is attempted with no addressed listeners on the bus or if a command-byte operation, such as <span class="Monospace">ibcmd</span> or <span class="Monospace">SendCmds</span>, is attempted and no devices are present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">3</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">GPIB Controller not addressed correctly. This error occurs when the board is the Controller-In-Charge and is not properly addressed before starting a transfer. For example, <span class="Monospace">ibrd</span> returns <span class="Monospace">EADR</span> if the interface is not addressed as a listener. <span class="Monospace">ibgts</span> also can return this error if the board is not properly addressed for shadow handshaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">4</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Invalid argument or arguments to function call. This error occurs when a driver function is called with an invalid parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">5</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Command requires GPIB Controller to be System Controller. This error occurs when the board is not the System Controller but needs to be to perform the requested operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">6</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">I/O operation aborted. This error occurs when the I/O operation is aborted due to timeout, <span class="Monospace">ibstop</span>, or Device Clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">7</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Nonexistent GPIB interface. Board-level functions return <span class="Monospace">ENEB</span> when the specified interface is configured in <span class="Monospace">ibconf</span> but cannot be found in the system. Device-level functions return <span class="Monospace">ENEB</span> when the specified access board of a device cannot be found in the system, even if the access board is configured in <span class="Monospace">ibconf</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">8</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">DMA hardware error detected. This error occurs when the driver has DMA enabled but cannot use DMA to transfer a buffer. The error can be due to an operating system error, such as when the operating system is unable to provide a physical address to the driver. The error also can be due to a hardware limitation, such as when the DMA controller cannot address your buffer and the driver cannot remap the buffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">9</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">DMA hardware uP bus timeout. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">10</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Asynchronous I/O operation in progress. This error occurs when a thread starts asynchronous I/O and then attempts to access the interface while the interface is still in an unsynchronized state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">11</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">No capability for operation. This error occurs when you try to take advantage of a driver feature that is either not implemented in the driver or is not currently usable. For example, if you disabled hardware DMA by removing the DRQ/DACK jumpers on her legacy AT-GPIB/TNT, a call to <span class="Monospace">ibconfigIbcDMA</span> with a value of <span class="Monospace">1</span> to enable DMA would return this error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">12</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">File system operation error. This error occurs when an <span class="Monospace">ibrdf</span> or <span class="Monospace">ibwrtf</span> call encounters a problem accessing the specified file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">13</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Shareable board exclusively owned. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">14</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">GPIB bus error. This error occurs while sending out GPIB command bytes. This error is only returned by functions that indirectly send out command bytes. For example, a device-level <span class="Monospace">ibwrt</span> returns <span class="Monospace">EBUS</span> if it is unable to send the addressing command bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">15</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Serial poll byte queue overflow. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">16</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">SRQ stuck in ON position. This error occurs when the driver is unable to wait for the RQS bit to set during a device-level <span class="Monospace">ibwait</span>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><span class="Monospace-Bold">20</span></td>
<td class="Bordered">Table error. This error occurs when there is a problem with a table used by a driver function. <span class="Monospace">FindLstn</span> returns <span class="Monospace">ETAB</span> when it finds more listeners on the bus than will fit in the table you provided. <span class="Monospace">FindRQS</span> and <span class="Monospace">AllSpoll</span> return <span class="Monospace">ETAB</span> if the list of addresses to serial poll is empty or none of the devices in the list are asserting SRQ.</td>
