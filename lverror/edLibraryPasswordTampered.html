<h1>VI's record of owning library's password does not match library's actual password</h1>
<p class="Body">When a VI is owned by a project library, it uses the password for the library in combination with its own password for security. These passwords prevent anyone from removing the VI from the library unless that person is similarly authorized to edit the library itself. If you edit the password for the library, LabVIEW loads all of the VIs in the library into memory so the VIs can update their security to use the library's new password. However, if LabVIEW cannot find a VI at that time, it is not updated. If you later load that VI into memory, the VI's record of the password for the library and the current password for the library are out of sync, and this error occurs.</p>
<p class="Body">To correct this error you must supply the old library password.</p>
