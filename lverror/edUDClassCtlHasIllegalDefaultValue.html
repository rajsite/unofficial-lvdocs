<h1>Private data control of this class uses an illegal value for its default data</h1>
<p class="Body">The private data control defines the default value for a <a href="../lvconcepts/OOP_in_LV.html">LabVIEW class</a>. This error occurs when the private data control has values set as the defaults that are illegal. Illegal default values include the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any value of this class itself</li>
<li>Any value of any child class</li>
<li>Any class LabVIEW has not loaded into memory</li>
<li>Any class that uses this class as a member in its own private data control</li>
</ul>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW is a by-value language and does not have a &quot;reference to class&quot; control. If you include a class control in the private data cluster, LabVIEW includes the entire class value in the private data. Instantiating a class that contains itself would result in the data type definition recursing infinitely and allocating by value at every level until memory was full. Only a class that is fully defined without using itself as part of its definition can be used as fields of the private data control.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">To correct this error, check for these illegal default values. Check class controls and variant controls for illegal default values.</p>
