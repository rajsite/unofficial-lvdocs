<h1>This LabVIEW class is missing at least one member VI</h1>
<p class="Body">This VI is a member of the LabVIEW class. LabVIEW cannot execute any part of the LabVIEW class because LabVIEW cannot find one or more member VIs of the class. LabVIEW displays <strong>missing VI</strong> in the Project Window next to any member VI that is missing from the library.</p>

<p class="Body">To correct this error, find the missing member VIs on disk and load them into memory or delete the member VIs from the LabVIEW class definition in the <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_LabVIEW_Projects.html">Project Explorer</a> window.</p>

<p class="Body">Previously saving a member VI in a version of LabVIEW that is newer than the version you are currently running can result in this error.</p>
