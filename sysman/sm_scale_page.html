<h1>Scaling Page (Shared Variable Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> NI Distributed System Manager (Windows)</p>

<p class="Body">Select the <strong>Scaling</strong> option in the listbox of the <a href="../sysman/sm_sharedvar_props_db.html">Shared Variable Properties</a> dialog box to display this page. Use this page to configure scaling for shared variables.</p>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use scaling only for network-published shared variables, I/O variables, and I/O aliases. The shared variable you want to scale also must have a data source. Configure a shared variable to have a data source by placing a checkmark in the <strong>Enable Aliasing</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../sysman/sm_variable_page.html">Variable</a> page of the <strong>Shared Variable Properties</strong> dialog box.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">This page can include the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Enable Scaling</strong>&#8212;Enables LabVIEW to scale the shared variable value.</li>
<li><strong>Scale Type</strong>&#8212;Sets the type of scaling to use when communicating with the data source. Different types of scaling are available depending on the data type of the shared variable. <ul>
<li><strong>Linear</strong>&#8212;Performs linear scaling between the <strong>Raw Scale</strong> and the <strong>Engineering Scale</strong> for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Square Root</strong>&#8212;Performs a square root operation when converting from the <strong>Raw Scale</strong> range to the <strong>Engineering Scale</strong> range for shared variables with a supported data type. The following equation defines the square root operation: <em>b</em> + <em>m</em> * <em>sqrt</em>(<em>raw</em> &#8211; <em>o</em>) where <em>b</em> = <strong>Engineering Zero Scale</strong>, <em>m</em> = (<strong>Engineering Full Scale</strong> &#8211; <strong>Engineering Zero Scale</strong>)/sqrt(<strong>Raw Full Scale</strong> &#8211; <strong>Raw Zero Scale</strong>), and <em>o</em> = <strong>Raw Zero Scale</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Engineering Unit</strong>&#8212;Specifies the engineering unit for the shared variable.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Full Scale</strong>&#8212;Specifies the maximum value of the scale you want to use to collect the data from the data source. The raw scale is the original scale that you used to collect the data. The <strong>Raw Full Scale</strong> value must be greater than the <strong>Raw Zero Scale</strong> value. This option appears for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Full Scale</strong>&#8212;Specifies the maximum value the Shared Variable Engine and HMI application use to scale the data source. The engineering scale is the full range that you want the Shared Variable Engine to use to scale the data source. This option appears for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Zero Scale</strong>&#8212;Specifies the minimum value of the scale you want to use to collect the data from the data source. The raw scale is the original scale that you used to collect the data. The <strong>Raw Zero Scale</strong> value must be less than the <strong>Raw Full Scale</strong> value. This option appears for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Zero Scale</strong>&#8212;Specifies the minimum value the Shared Variable Engine and HMI application use to scale the data source. The engineering scale is the full range that you want the Shared Variable Engine to use to scale the data source. This option appears for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Coerce to Range</strong>&#8212;Coerces the data to the specified range so it is valid. If you scale the data for a shared variable you can write, the data must be within the <strong>Raw Scale</strong> range. If you scale the data for a shared variable you can read, the data must be within the <strong>Engineering Scale</strong> range. This option appears for shared variables with a supported data type.</li>
<li><strong>Invert</strong>&#8212;Inverts data sent by the data source before storing it in the shared variable. This option appears for shared variables with a <strong>Data Type</strong> of <strong>Boolean</strong>.</li></ul>
