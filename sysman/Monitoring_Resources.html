<h1>Monitoring Real-Time Target Resources (Real-Time Module)</h1>

<p class="Body">Use the <a href="cpu_mem_probe.html">CPU/Memory</a> page of a real-time target probe to monitor the CPU and memory resources of a real-time target.</p>

<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong> You must install System State Publisher on the real-time target to monitor the target's CPU and memory resources.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to monitor the CPU and memory resources of a real-time target.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click a real-time target in the system tree to display a target probe in the <strong>Auto View</strong>. You also can right-click a target and select <strong>Probe</strong> to display a target probe in a separate window.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>CPU/Memory</strong> tab to display CPU and memory statistics.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Body">The System Manager displays a CPU chart for each CPU in the system, labeled by CPU index. Each graph tracks the utilization of the CPU, as a percentage of capacity, over time. For each CPU, the System Manager also displays the percentage of total CPU utilization devoted to each priority level, as well as the percentage devoted to interrupt service routines (ISRs) and Timed Structures. The System Manager also displays a Memory chart that tracks memory usage, in megabytes, over time.</p>
