<p class="Body">Use PID and Fuzzy Logic VIs for <a href="../lvpidmain/pid_overview.html">Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)</a> and <a href="../lvpidmain/fuzzy_main.html">fuzzy logic control</a>. These VIs appear under the <a href="../lvpid/Control_Sim_Pal.html">Control &amp; Simulation</a> palette. You can use the <a href="../lvpid/PIDTitle.html">PID</a> VIs with input/output (I/O) functions such as data acquisition (DAQ) to implement control of physical processes.</p>
<h2>PID Control</h2>
<p class="Body">The <a href="../lvpidmain/pid_overview.html">Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)</a> algorithm is the most common control algorithm used in industry. A PID controller is a feedback controller you can use to control processes such as heating and cooling systems, fluid level monitoring, flow control, pressure control, and so on. You can use the <a href="../lvpid/PIDTitle.html">PID</a> VIs with National Instruments hardware such as a DAQ device, FieldPoint I/O module, or GPIB board, to connect your PC to a system and develop LabVIEW control applications. You also can use the PID VIs with LabVIEW math and logic functions to create block diagrams for real control strategies.</p>
<h2>Fuzzy Logic</h2>
<p class="Body"><a href="../lvpidmain/fuzzy_main.html">Fuzzy logic</a> is a method of rule-based decision making for expert systems and process control. Fuzzy logic differs from traditional Boolean logic in that fuzzy logic allows for partial membership in a set. You can use fuzzy logic to control processes represented by subjective, linguistic descriptions. You can wire acquired data to a fuzzy controller to implement real-time decision making or control of a physical system. You also can use outputs of the fuzzy controller with DAQ analog output hardware to implement real-time process control.</p>
<p class="Body">Use the <a href="../lvpid/Fuzzy_System_Designer_DB.html">Fuzzy System Designer</a> to design a fuzzy system interactively. Use the <a href="../lvpid/FuzzyLogicTitle.html">Fuzzy Logic</a> VIs to design and control fuzzy systems programmatically.</p>
