			Fuzzy logic is a method of rule-based decision making used for expert systems and process control. Fuzzy logic differs from traditional Boolean logic in that fuzzy logic allows for partial membership in a set.</p>
<p class="Body">Traditional Boolean logic is two-valued in the sense that a member either belongs to a set or does not. Values of one and zero represent the membership of a member to the set with one representing absolute membership and zero representing no membership. Fuzzy logic allows for partial membership, or a degree of membership, which might be any value along the continuum of zero to one.</p>
<p class="Body">You can think of fuzzy logic in terms of <a href="fuzzy_systems.html">fuzzy systems</a>, which are systems of variables associated with fuzzy logic, and <a href="fuzzy_controllers.html">fuzzy controllers</a>, which use defined rules to control a fuzzy system based on the current values of input variables. You can use the <a href="../lvpid/FuzzyLogicTitle.html">Fuzzy Logic</a> VIs to design and control fuzzy systems. You also can use the <a href="../lvpid/Fuzzy_System_Designer_DB.html">Fuzzy System Designer</a> to design fuzzy systems interactively.
