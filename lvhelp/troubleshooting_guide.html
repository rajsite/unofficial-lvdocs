<h2>Installing the NI LabVIEW Application Builder (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>The instructions for installing the Application Builder depend on which package of LabVIEW you purchased.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>LabVIEW Professional Development System</strong>&#8212;The LabVIEW Professional Development System includes and automatically installs the Application Builder. Therefore, you do not install the Application Builder separately. <strong>(Windows)</strong> During installation, the serial number for LabVIEW also activates the Application Builder. 					
	</li>
	<li><strong>LabVIEW Full Development System or Base Development System</strong>&#8212;If you also purchased the Application Builder, you receive a separate package for it. 				
		<ul>
			<li><strong>(Windows)</strong> Install LabVIEW from the LabVIEW Platform media. During installation, you must enter a serial number for the Application Builder. Locate this serial number on the <em>Certificate of Ownership</em> in the LabVIEW Add-On Software package. If you do not activate the Application Builder during installation, it runs in evaluation mode. You can activate the Application Builder after installing LabVIEW from the <strong>License Status</strong> window that appears when you launch LabVIEW.</li>
			<li><strong>(macOS and Linux)</strong> After you finish installing LabVIEW, insert the installation media for the Application Builder.</li>

<h2>Installing LabVIEW 2020 on a Computer That Already Has a Previous Version of LabVIEW (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>Installing LabVIEW 2020 does not overwrite previous versions of LabVIEW that are installed on a computer because each version of LabVIEW resides in a separate directory. To use files from the <span class="Monospace">user.lib</span> directory of a previous version of LabVIEW, copy those files into the <span class="Monospace">user.lib</span> directory of LabVIEW 2020.</p>

<p>For detailed recommendations about upgrading VIs and projects from a previous version of LabVIEW, refer to the <a href="javascript:AcrobatLink('../manuals/LV_Upgrade_Notes.pdf');">LabVIEW Upgrade Notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Locating Missing Module or Toolkit Functionality (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>To use a module or toolkit with LabVIEW 2020, you must install a version of the module or toolkit that is compatible with LabVIEW 2020. Otherwise, the VIs, project items, dialog boxes, and other features associated with the module or toolkit do not appear in LabVIEW.</p>
<p>Complete the following steps to locate and install missing modules and toolkits:</p>
<p><strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
<ol><li>Locate and install the module or toolkit.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Modules and toolkits that ship on the LabVIEW Platform media</strong>&mdash;Insert the LabVIEW Platform media and enter the serial number of the module or toolkit. To determine if a module or toolkit <a href="#platformDVDs">ships on the LabVIEW Platform media</a>, refer to the <em>LabVIEW Platform Readme</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>All other LabVIEW modules and toolkits</strong>&mdash;Follow the <a href="#nonplatformToolkits">instructions for add-ons not included on the LabVIEW Platform media</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>Third-party add-ons</strong>&mdash;From the <strong>Getting Started</strong> window of LabVIEW, select <strong>Find Drivers and Add-ons&#0187;Find LabVIEW Add-ons</strong> to access the latest versions of third-party add-ons.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Modify the device drivers. If you install LabVIEW or an add-on after installing device drivers, LabVIEW cannot recognize the device drivers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(macOS and Linux)</strong></p>
<p>Install a version of the module or toolkit that is compatible with LabVIEW 2020. You can obtain a compatible version of the module or toolkit from the following locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>For NI add-ons</strong>&mdash;Download the latest version of the add-on from <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_NICOMDOWNLOADS)">ni.com/downloads</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>For third-party add-ons</strong>&mdash;Download the latest version of the add-on from the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_LVToolsNetwork)">LabVIEW Tools Network</a> at <span class="Monospace">ni.com</span>.</li>
</ul> 
<p>For installation instructions, refer to the readme file on the installation media of the module or toolkit.</p>

<h2>Resolving VI Behaviors That Changed Since a Previous Version of LabVIEW (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>To identify the parts of a VI that cause it to behave differently in LabVIEW 2020 than in the version of LabVIEW in which it was created, refer to the <em>Upgrade and Compatibility Issues</em> section of the <a href="javascript:AcrobatLink('../manuals/LV_Upgrade_Notes.pdf');">LabVIEW Upgrade Notes</a>. Review the section for each LabVIEW version since the version in which the VI was created.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<a name="oldVIs"></a>
<h2>Determining Why LabVIEW 2020 Cannot Open VIs from a Previous Version of LabVIEW (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>If you are upgrading a VI from LabVIEW 5.1 or earlier, you cannot open the VI in LabVIEW 2020. To upgrade a VI from one of these versions of LabVIEW, you must first upgrade to an intermediate version of LabVIEW or use the LabVIEW Conversion Package. Refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_UPConversion)">How to Upgrade or Revert a VI to a Different Version of LabVIEW</a> support document at <span class="Monospace">ni.com</span> for more information about upgrading from your specific legacy version of LabVIEW.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<a name="LVversion"></a>
<h2>Determining Which Versions of NI Software Are Installed</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>Use the Measurement &amp; Automation Explorer or the system tools available on your machine to <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_Findsoftware)">determine which versions of NI software you have installed</a>, including modules, toolkits, and drivers.</p>
</td></tr></table>


<a name="restore"></a>
<h2>Restoring VIs to a Previous Version of LabVIEW</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>After you save a VI in a new version of LabVIEW, you cannot automatically load it in an earlier version of LabVIEW. To allow the VI to run in the previous version, open the VI and select <strong>File&#0187;Save for Previous Version</strong>. Refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_VIPREVVERSION)">NI website</a> for more information about loading VIs in a previous version of LabVIEW.</p>
 <p>If your computer does not have enough memory to convert all the VIs at once, convert the VIs in stages. Examine the hierarchy of VIs you want to convert and begin by loading and saving subVIs in the lower levels of the hierarchy. Then progress gradually to the higher levels of the hierarchy. Open and convert the top-level VI last. You also can select <strong>Tools&#0187;Advanced&#0187;Mass Compile</strong> to convert a directory of VIs. However, mass compiling converts VIs in a directory or LLB in a set order. Refer to the <a href="../lvhowto/mass_compiling_vis.html">Mass Compiling VIs</a> topic for a description of the order in which LabVIEW processes files when you mass compile. If the conversion process encounters a high-level VI first, mass compiling requires approximately the same amount of memory as if you opened the high-level VI first.</p>

<a name="uninstall"></a>
<h2>Uninstalling LabVIEW (All Platforms)</h2>
<table><tr><td></td><td>
<p>When troubleshooting a persistent installation issue, you might choose to uninstall LabVIEW and other NI software to retry installation on a clean machine.</p>
<p><strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a system configuration report in Measurement &amp; Automation Explorer (MAX), which is a hardware configuration program that is installed when you install LabVIEW. The system configuration report records the state of your system before you erase all information about your NI software installations.
