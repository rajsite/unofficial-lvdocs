<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to align navigation controls and front panel windows of the VIs in a project library. For example, you may want to align the navigation controls to create a consistent user interface for a multi-panel application. You also can use this dialog box to customize the appearance of navigation controls.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Navigation Controls Tree View</strong>&#8212;Displays the tree view of items in the LabVIEW <a href="../lvconcepts/Project_Libraries.html">project library</a> that contain navigation controls.<br><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Item</strong>&#8212;Specifies the items in the owning project library that contain navigation controls.</li>
<li><strong>Button Type</strong>&#8212;Specifies the button type, such as Previous Button, Next Button, or Jump Button, of the navigation control.</li>
<li><strong>Target VI</strong>&#8212;Specifies the VI that the navigation control targets. The controls navigate through the VIs in a project library based on the order the VIs appear in the project library. If you want to change the order of the VIs, you must <a href="../lvconcepts/Project_Libraries.html#Organizing_Project__Libraries">change the order in the project library</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Align</strong>&#8212;Use the <strong>Align</strong> page to align navigation controls and front panel windows of the VIs in a project library.  This page includes the following components:<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Align navigation buttons</strong>&#8212;Specifies to move and resize instances of the same button type to the button you select in the pull-down menu. You can select the following options:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply to all instances in the project library</strong>&#8212;Aligns the instances of the same button type in all VIs in the owning project library to the button you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to instances in the current folder of the project library</strong>&#8212;Aligns the instances of the same button type in VIs grouped in the same folder in the owning project library to the button you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to selected instances</strong>&#8212;Aligns the button(s) you select in the <strong>Navigation Controls Tree View</strong> to the button you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>&#8212;Sets the alignment of buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Align panels</strong>&#8212;Specifies to move and resize the front panel windows for the other VIs in the project library to match the position and size of the VI you select in the pull-down menu. You can select the following options:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply to all instances in the project library</strong>&#8212;Aligns the front panel windows for all VIs in the owning project library to the VI you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to instances in the current folder of the project library</strong>&#8212;Aligns only the front panel windows for VIs grouped in the same folder in the owning project library to the VI you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to owning VIs of selected instances</strong>&#8212;Aligns the front panel windows for VIs you select in the <strong>Navigation Controls Tree View</strong> to the VI you select in the pull-down menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>&#8212;Sets the alignment of panels.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Customize</strong>&#8212;Use the <strong>Customize</strong> page to select a control file to use as a navigation button. This page includes the following components:<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Path to selected navigation button</strong>&#8212;Specifies the file path to the navigation button(s) you select in the <strong>Navigation Controls Tree View</strong> that you want to customize. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you select more than one navigation button, this option displays the file path to buttons that have the same file path. If the file paths to the navigation buttons are different, this option does not display any file path.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Customize</strong>&#8212;Prompts you to select a Boolean type control file (.<span class="Monospace">ctl</span>) to use as a navigation button. LabVIEW creates an <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_LabVIEW_XControls.html">XControl</a> for the control file you select to use as the navigation button. This option is valid only if the navigation buttons you select in the <strong>Navigation Controls Tree View</strong> are the same button type. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You also can replace a navigation control with an existing XControl by right-clicking the navigation control from the front panel, selecting <strong>Replace</strong> from the shortcut menu, and selecting the XControl to use.</td></tr></table></li></ul></li></ul>
