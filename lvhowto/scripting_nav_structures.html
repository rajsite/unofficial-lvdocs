<h1>Navigating across a Structure Using VI Scripting</h1>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> <a href="enabling_vi_scripting.html">VI Scripting</a></p>
<p>You navigate across a structure any time that you inspect, edit, or create references to a particular part of a structure. Navigating across a structure is a unique navigation task because the elements of a structure are connected by the structure itself rather than by wires. Therefore, to navigate a structure, you must not only be aware of the different elements that compose a structure but also of the properties that return references to these elements. You can combine navigating across structures with other navigation subtasks to accomplish larger navigation goals. Refer to the <a href="../lvhowto/scripting_navigation_overview.html">navigation overview</a> to learn more about how navigating across structures interacts with other navigation tasks.</p>
<p class="Body"></p>

<a name="whatYouNeed"></a><h2>What to Use</h2>
<p>To navigate across a structure, you use properties of the structure to obtain references to different parts of the anatomy of the structure. The properties you need to navigate across a structure depend on the structure that you are navigating. Refer to the following structure anatomies to identify which properties you need to navigate a particular structure.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="../lvconcepts/anatomy.html#For">Loop Properties</a></li>
	<li><a href="../lvconcepts/anatomy.html#Case">Case Structure Properties</a></li>
	<li><a href="../lvconcepts/anatomy.html#Flat">Timed Sequence Structure Properties</a></li>
</ul>

		
<a name="how"></a><h2>What to Do</h2>
<p><strong>Before you start: </strong>Open the Navigating Structures VI in the <span class="Monospace">labview\examples\Application Control\VI Scripting\Finding and Modifying Objects</span> directory for an example that illustrates each step of the following procedure.</p>
<a href="javascript:openVI('examples%5C%5CApplication%20Control%5C%5CVI%20Scripting%5C%5CFinding%20and%20Modifying%20Objects%5C%5CNavigating%20Structures.vi');"><img src="open.gif" border="0" style="padding-bottom: 4px; vertical-align: middle"></a>&nbsp;Open Example
<p>Expand the procedure for more information about this specific example.</p>

	<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_obtaining_object_references.html">Obtain a reference</a> to the structure you want to navigate.
<p class="expanded"><span class="expandable-underline">Example Details</span></p>		<div class="expandable-section-open"><p>In the example, the scripting VI uses the <a href="../glang/TRef_Traverse_for_References.html">Traverse for GObjects</a> VI to obtain references to all the Case structures in the target VI.</p></div>
	</li>
	<li>Use the structure reference to obtain a reference to the element of the structure that is relevant to your overall navigation task.
		<p>Possible structure elements include tunnels, shift registers, Case structure frame names, and so on. Refer to the <a href="../lvconcepts/anatomy.html">anatomies of common VI objects</a> for a visual depiction of the parts of different types of structures.</p>
<p class="expanded"><span class="expandable-underline">Example Details</span></p>		<div class="expandable-section-open"><p>In the example, the scripting goal is to navigate to and analyze the object that is wired to the case selector. Therefore, the scripting VI uses the <a href="../lvscript/CaseStructure_Selector.html">Case Structure:Selector</a> property to obtain a reference to the selector tunnel of each Case structure. This reference enables navigation to continue toward the wired object.</p></div>
	</li>
	<li>Use the reference to the structure element to either edit the element or to continue navigating.
		<p>As the structure anatomies indicate, some elements of a structure provide access to other elements of the structure. For example, you can use a reference to a tunnel to obtain a reference to the inner and outer terminals of that tunnel.</p>
<p class="expanded"><span class="expandable-underline">Example Details</span></p>		<div class="expandable-section-open"><p>In the example, the scripting VI uses the reference to the case selector to continue <a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_node_to_wire.html">navigating from a node (the case selector) to a connected wire</a>. The scripting VI uses the <a href="../lvscript/Tunnel_Outside_Terminal.html">Tunnel:Outside Terminal</a> property of the case selector to obtain a reference to the outer terminal of the case selector. The scripting VI requires the terminal reference to obtain a reference to the connected wire.</p></div>
	</li>
	<li>Use the <a href="../glang/Close_LV_Object_Reference.html">Close Reference</a> function to close every reference to a structure or structure element when you are finished using them.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="bestpractices"></a><h2>Caveats and Recommendations</h2>
<p><strong>Close all references that you open</strong>&#8212;An excessive number of open references negatively impacts the performance of a VI.  Read about <a href="../lvhowto/scripting_closing_references.html">closing VI and object references</a> for more performance details.</p>
