<h1>Grouping and Locking Objects
</h1>
<!-- begin parent = lvconcepts/Building_the_Front_Panel.xml -->
<p class="Body">Use the Positioning tool to select the front panel objects you want to group and lock together. Click the <strong>Reorder</strong> button ( <img src="noloc_env_reorder.gif"/> ) on the toolbar and select <strong>Group</strong> or <strong>Lock</strong> from the pull-down menu. Grouped objects maintain their relative arrangement and size when you use the Positioning tool to move and resize them. Locked objects maintain their position on the front panel. You cannot delete individual objects that are grouped from the front panel or block diagram until you ungroup them. You cannot delete locked objects from the front panel or the block diagram until you unlock them. You can set objects to be grouped and locked at the same time. If you set objects to be grouped and locked at the same time, you must ungroup and unlock them before you can delete them from the front panel or the block diagram. Tools other than the Positioning tool work normally with grouped or locked objects.
