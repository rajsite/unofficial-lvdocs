	<h1>Checking in Files to Source Control</h1>

<p class="Body">When you finish making changes to a file you <a href="Checking_Out_Files.html">checked out</a>, check in the file to copy that version into source control so it is available to other users.
</p>
<p class="Body"> To check files into source control, LabVIEW must be <a href="../lvhowto/Configuring_SCC.html">configured to use source control</a>.</p>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to check a file in to source control.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are in a project, select the folder or files you want to check in.
<br><br>
If you are working on individual VIs outside a project, open the VI you want to check in.
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Tools&#0187;Source Control&#0187;Check In</strong> to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Source_Control_Ops_DB.html">Source Control Operations</a> dialog box. From within a project, you also can click the <strong>Check In</strong> button on the <a href="../glang/Source_Control_Toolbar.html">Source Control toolbar</a> or right-click the file or folder and select <strong>Check In</strong> from the shortcut menu.
</li>
<li>The <strong>Files</strong> tree contains the names and paths of all files to check in to source control. Remove the checkmark from the checkbox next to the name of any file you do not want to check in to source control.
</li>
<li>Enter a summary of the changes you made in the <strong>Comment</strong> text box.
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to check in the files. If any files in the source control operation have unsaved changes, the <a href="../lvdialog/SCC_Save_DB.html">Unsaved Files</a> dialog box appears when you click the <strong>OK</strong> button. If you are in a project, the red checkmark disappears from the file icon to show that the file no longer is checked out of source control.
</li></ol>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the source control provider, if you attempt to close the <a href="../lvdialog/Source_Control_Ops_DB.html">Source Control Operations</a> dialog box and the <strong>Comment</strong> text box is empty, a provider-specific dialog box might display so you can enter the information.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">Depending on the source control provider you are using, the provider might automatically set the file as read-only while it is checked in to prevent you or others from accidentally modifying the file without checking it out again.
