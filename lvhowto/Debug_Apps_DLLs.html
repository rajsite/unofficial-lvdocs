<h1>Debugging Applications and Shared Libraries</h1>

<p class="Body">You can debug stand-alone applications and shared libraries that you create with the Application Builder.</p>

<p class="Body">Complete the following instructions to debug a stand-alone application or shared library.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you debug applications and shared libraries, you cannot debug reentrant panels that an Open VI Reference function creates or reentrant panels that are entry points to LabVIEW-built shared libraries. You also cannot debug subVIs within Diagram Disable structures. SubVIs within Diagram Disable structures appear as question marks while you debug an application. However, because code in a Diagram Disable structure does not execute, this does not affect debugging.</td></tr></table>
<ol>
<li>Before you build the application or shared library, you must enable debugging in the build specification. For an application, place a checkmark in the <strong>Enable debugging</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/App_Settings_Tab.html">Advanced</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Build_App_or_DLL_DB.html">Application Properties</a> dialog box. For a shared library, place a checkmark in the <strong>Enable debugging</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/Advanced_DLL_Page.html">Advanced</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/DLL_Settings_DB.html">Shared Library Properties</a> dialog box. Enabling debugging retains the block diagrams of the VIs in the build so you can perform debugging.</li>
<li>Place a checkmark in the <strong>Wait for debugger on launch</strong> checkbox if you want the application or shared library to wait to run any VIs until you run the debugging tool.</li>
<li>Build the application or shared library.</li>
<li>Run the built application or call the shared library from outside of LabVIEW.</li>
<li>From the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window, select <strong>Operate&#0187;Debug Application or Shared Library</strong> to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Debug_App_DLL_DB.html">Debug Application or Shared Library</a> dialog box. The dialog box displays a list of applications and shared libraries with debugging enabled.</li>
<li>If the application or shared library you want to debug is running on a different computer, enter the computer name in the <strong>Machine name or IP address</strong> text box. Click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to view the list of applications and shared libraries with debugging enabled on the remote computer.</li>
<li>Select the application or shared library you want to debug.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button to perform debugging. LabVIEW downloads the application or shared library and the front panel of the startup VI appears for debugging. If you enabled <strong>Wait for debugger on launch</strong>, you must click the <strong>Run</strong> button to start the application or shared library.</li>
<li>Use the block diagram of the startup VI to debug the application or shared library. You can use probes, breakpoints, and other <a href="../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html">debugging techniques</a> to identify problems. You then can correct any problems found during debugging.</li>
</ol>
<table class="Borderless">

<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are debugging using a custom probe that uses a Call Library Function Node on a shared library that was not built with the application or shared library you want to debug, you must place the shared library in the same directory as the application or shared library you want to debug.</td></tr></table>
<ol start="10">
<li>After you finish debugging, close the startup VI, which also closes the remotely controlled application or shared library. If you want to disconnect the remotely controlled application or shared library without closing the startup VI, right-click the startup VI and select <strong>Remote Debugging&#0187;Quit Debug Session</strong> from the shortcut menu.</li>

<p class="Body">The following scenarios might cause the <span class="Monospace">No debuggable applications or runtime libraries found</span> error to appear.</p> 
<ul>
<li>The debuggable application or shared library was not loaded or the debuggable shared library was unloaded by the application. </li>
<li>The configuration (<span class="Monospace">ini</span>) file of the shared library or application, created by the Application Builder, was not distributed with the shared library or application. </li>
