<h1>Resizing Multiple Objects to the Same Size
</h1>
<p class="Body">Use the <strong>Resize Objects</strong> pull-down menu to resize multiple front panel objects to the same size. <!-- Begin parent: lvconcepts/Building_the_Front_Panel.xml -->You can resize all the selected objects to the width or height of the largest or smallest object, and you can resize all the selected objects to a specific size in pixels.<!-- End parent: lvconcepts/Building_the_Front_Panel.xml -->

<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you add splitter bars to the front panel and create panes, you can select objects on multiple panes by pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key and selecting the objects you want to resize.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to resize multiple front panel objects.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the objects you want to resize to the same size.
</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Resize Objects</strong> pull-down menu, located between the <a href="Distributing_Objects.html">Distribute Objects</a> and <a href="Reordering_Objects.html">Reorder</a> pull-down menus on the toolbar on the front panel.
</li>
<li>Select from the following options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Width</strong>&#8212;Resizes the width of the selected objects to the width of the widest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Height</strong>&#8212;Resizes the height of the selected objects to the height of the tallest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Width and Height</strong>&#8212;Resizes the width of the selected objects to the width of the widest object, and resizes the height of the selected objects to the height of the tallest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Width</strong>&#8212;Resizes the width of the selected objects to the width of the narrowest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Height</strong>&#8212;Resizes the height of the selected objects to the height of the shortest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Width and Height</strong>&#8212;Resizes the width of the selected objects to the width of the narrowest object, and resizes the height of the selected objects to the height of the shortest object.
</li>
<li><strong>Set Width and Height</strong>&#8212;Displays the <a href="../lvdialog/Set_Width_Height_DB.html">Resize Objects</a> dialog box, which you can use to resize the selected objects to a specific size in pixels.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body"><!-- Begin parent: lvconcepts/Building_the_Front_Panel.xml -->Some objects change size only horizontally or vertically when you resize them, such as digital numeric controls and indicators. Others keep the same proportions when you resize them, such as knobs.<!-- End parent: lvconcepts/Building_the_Front_Panel.xml --> For example, if the selected objects whose height you want to resize include a digital numeric control, LabVIEW resizes the height of only the objects that can change size vertically and does not resize the height of the digital numeric control.
