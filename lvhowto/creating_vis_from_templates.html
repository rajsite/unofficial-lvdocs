<h1>Creating VIs from Templates and Sample Projects</h1>

<p class="Body">Select <strong>File&#0187;Create Project</strong> to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Create_Project_DB.html">Create Project</a> dialog box, which contains the following customizable templates and sample projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple State Machine</strong>&#8212;A template that defines sections of code and the order in which they execute.</li>
<li><strong>Finite Measurement</strong>&#8212;A sample project that uses the Simple State Machine template to acquire a single measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Queued Message Handler</strong>&#8212;A template that monitors a user interface while allowing you to perform other tasks, such as data acquisition or logging.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Measurement and Logging</strong>&#8212;A sample project that uses the Queued Message Handler template to acquire measurements continuously and log them to disk.</li>
<li><strong>Actor Framework</strong>&#8212;A template for an application that consists of multiple independent tasks that communicate with one another.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Evaporative Cooler</strong>&#8212;A sample project that uses the Actor Framework template to cool a water tank, where the cooler is represented by either simulated or real hardware, controlled either manually or automatically, and viewed with one of two user interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Touch Panel Project</strong>&#8212;A template that defines an application for a touch panel target running the Windows Embedded Standard operating system. This template includes a touch panel VI that runs on a touch panel target and a VI that runs on the host computer. The VI running on the host computer uses the Queued Message Handler template.</li>
</ul>

<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW add-ons may install additional templates and sample projects.</td></tr></table>

<p class="Body">Templates show how to implement commonly-used design patterns in LabVIEW code, whereas sample projects show how to use a template for a specific application. Each template and sample project contains the project libraries, functions, structures, and user interfaces necessary to get started developing a scalable, robust application.</p>
