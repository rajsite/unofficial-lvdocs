<h1>Integrating Static Content into a Web Service (Real-Time, Windows)</h1>

<p class="Body"><strong>Parent Topic: </strong> <a href="../lvconcepts/ws_developing.html">Developing Web Services</a></p>


<p class="Body">When you build a Web service, you can integrate static content such as HTML files, JavaScript files, CSS files, images, and videos from within the LabVIEW project. For example, you can publish stand-alone web pages using Web services or provide a user interface that interacts with the HTTP method VIs in a Web service.</p>



<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to integrate <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_NXGWeb)">LabVIEW NXG WebVIs</a> with a LabVIEW Web service, include the built WebVI files in the <strong>Public Content</strong> folder in your LabVIEW Web service project. Refer to <a href="../lvhowto/ws_ui_webvi.html">Using WebVIs to Create User Interfaces for Web Services</a> for more information.</td></tr></table>

<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to integrate static content into a Web service:</p>

<ol>
<li>Organize static content on disk in two main folders: one that contains public content and one that contains private content you do not want to expose to users.</li>
	
<li>Open the LabVIEW project that contains the Web service files.</li>

<li>Right-click the Web service project item <img src="noloc_env_ws_node.gif"> in the project tree and select <strong>Add Public Content Folder</strong> or <strong>Add Private Content Folder</strong>.</li>

<li>In the browse dialog box that appears, select the folder on disk that contains files you want to include in the Web service.</li>

<li>LabVIEW creates an auto-populating folder named <strong>Public Content</strong> or <strong>Private Content</strong> under the Web service project item. Any files in the folder on disk appear under the folder that you added to the project tree.<br /><br />The following project shows a project that contains a <strong>Public Content</strong> folder. The corresponding folder on disk contains the same files and subfolder as in the project tree.<br /><br />

<img src="loc_env_ws_proj_static.gif">
</li>
</ol>

<p class="Body">After you publish the Web service, you can access the static files from a client, such as a web browser, by navigating to the URL mapping for the file you want to access.</p>


<h2>Finding the URL Mapping for a Public File</h2>
<p class="Body">LabVIEW automatically assigns a URL mapping to each public static file. You cannot change this mapping. Complete one of the following steps to view the URL mapping for a public static file:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For a specific static file or folder, right-click the file in the project tree and select <strong>Show Public URL</strong>. </li>
	<li>To view URL mappings for all public static files and folders, right-click the Web service project item and select <strong>Properties</strong> to display the <strong>Web Service Properties</strong> dialog box. On the <strong>Site Map</strong> page, the table contains a row with the URL mapping for each public static file and folder.</li>
</ul>

<a name="default"></a><h2>Integrating Default HTML Files</h2>
	<p class="Body">You can include an <span class="Monospace">index.html</span> file within each public content folder and subfolder in the project. When a client sends an HTTP request using a URL such as <span class="Monospace">http://localhost/TutorialService/</span>, the Web service returns the <span class="Monospace">index.html</span> file. </p>

<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to integrate a default <span class="Monospace">index.html</span> file for a specific public content folder:</p>

<ol>
	<li>On disk, add a file named <span class="Monospace">index.html</span> to a folder that appears under the <strong>Public Content</strong> folder in the project. In the previous example, you place the file in the folder on disk that you associated with the top-level <strong>Public Content</strong> folder. The file automatically appears in the project tree unless you stop the folder from auto-populating changes in the corresponding folder on disk.
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif" alt="Note"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The file extension must be <span class="Monospace">.html</span>.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
	<li>Right-click the Web service project item and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the <a href="../lvdialog/ws_service_page.html">Service Settings</a> page, place a checkmark in the <strong>Serve default index.html for public folders</strong> checkbox, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
	<li>In a Web browser, navigate to the URL that corresponds to the folder with the <span class="Monospace">index.html</span> file. The HTML file loads in the browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Integrating Private Content in Web Services</h2>
<p class="Body">Private static files do not have URL mappings because web clients cannot access private content. To programmatically access private static content within Web service source files, use the Read Service Attribute VI to return the path to the folder that contains private content at run time. With the path to the private content folder, you can build a path to a specific file. Refer to the <a href="../lvcomm/read_service_attribute.html">Read Service Attribute</a> VI help for more information.</p>
