<h1>Building a Universal Framework on macOS</h1>

<p>A universal framework, or shared library, contains both 64-bit and 32-bit code so that both 64-bit and 32-bit applications can call the framework. You need both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of LabVIEW to build a universal framework. Complete the following steps to build a universal framework in LabVIEW:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Using 64-bit LabVIEW, build the framework that you want to make universal. LabVIEW builds the framework with 64-bit VI code.</li>
    <li>Using 32-bit LabVIEW, build the same framework you built in the previous step. LabVIEW builds the framework with 32-bit VI code.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the 32-bit framework on disk, and copy the <span class="Monospace">.llb</span> file from the 32-bit framework into the 64-bit framework you created in step 1. After you copy the <span class="Monospace">.llb</span> file into the 64-bit framework, you no longer need the 32-bit framework you created in step 2.
		<table class="Borderless">
			<tr>
				<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
				<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must copy the <span class="Monospace">.llb</span> file from the 32-bit framework into the 64-bit framework. The framework does not work universally if you copy the <span class="Monospace">.llb</span> file from the 64-bit framework into the 32-bit framework.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>You can now call the framework you built in step 1 from both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.</p>
