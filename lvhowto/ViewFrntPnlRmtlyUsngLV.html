<h1>Viewing an Application or Front Panel Remotely Using LabVIEW</h1>

<p class="Body">To view an application or front panel remotely using LabVIEW, you must first configure the server. Complete the following steps to configure the server so a client computer can view a front panel remotely using LabVIEW.</p>

<!--begin child=lvhowto.chm,ViewFPRmtlyUsngBrwsr.html--><table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="tip.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Tip</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;For VIs that will be viewed or controlled remotely, create as small front panels as possible. The Web Server uses more system resources to load and display large front panel images than small front panel images, which can slow the execution of the VI itself.</td></tr></table><!--end child=lvhowto.chm,ViewFPRmtlyUsngBrwsr.html-->

<ol><li>Enable the Web Server on the server computer where the <a href="Enabling_and_Configuring_t.html">VI</a> or <a href="Enabling_the_Web_Server_in.html">application</a> you want to view is located.</li>

<li>Configure the <a href="Adding_New_Browser_Access.html">browser access list</a> so the client computer can connect to the server.</li>

<li>Configure the <a href="Adding_New_Visible_VIs_En.html">visible VIs list</a> so the client computer can access the VI or application front panels remotely. If you do not configure the visible VIs list, the client can access all VIs that are loaded into memory on the server computer.</li>

<li>Make sure the application is running or the VIs whose front panels you want clients to view are in memory on the server computer.</li></ol>

<br>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps if you are on a client computer and want to view a front panel remotely using LabVIEW.</p>


<ol><li>Select <strong>Operate&#0187;Connect to Remote Panel</strong> to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Remote_Panel_Dialog_Box.html">Connect to Remote Panel</a> dialog box.</li>

<li>In the <strong>Server address</strong> field, enter the IP address or computer name of the server to which you want to connect.</li>

<li>In the <strong>VI name</strong> field, enter the name of the VI whose front panel you want to view. Or enter the name of the top-level VI of the application you want to view. </li>

<li>Enter the HTTP Port. The default is <span class="Monospace">80</span>.</li>

<li>If you want to immediately request control of the front panel, place a checkmark in the <strong>Request control</strong> checkbox. You also can <a href="CtrlngFPRmtlyUsngBrwsr.html">request control</a> at the bottom of the remote front panel window when it appears on your computer.</li>

<li>Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button. The front panel appears on your computer allowing you to view it. If access is denied, an <a href="Caveats_RmtPnl.html">error message</a> appears in the <strong>Connection status</strong> section of the <strong>Connect to Remote Panel</strong> dialog box.</li></ol>

<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Begin parent: ../lvconcepts/Networking_in_LabVIEW.xml -->If you want to save the data generated by a VI running on a remote computer, use <a href="Reading_Live_Data_Programm.html">DataSocket</a> or <a href="Creating_TCP_Client.html">TCP</a> instead of remote front panels.<!-- End parent: ../lvconcepts/Networking_in_LabVIEW.xml--></td></tr></table>

<p class="Body">To completely close your connection to the Web Server running on the server computer, click the close glyph on the LabVIEW window border.</p>

<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Begin parent: 6100Ecomm -->The server computer managing remote front panels must have the LabVIEW Full or Professional Development System or must build the front panels into a stand-alone application. Clients can use any LabVIEW development system to view and control those front panels remotely.<!-- End parent: 6100Ecomm --></td></tr></table>

<p class="Body">You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/Application_m.html">Application</a> methods to open a connection and request control of a remote front panel programmatically.</p>
