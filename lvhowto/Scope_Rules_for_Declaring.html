<h1>Scope Rules for Declaring Variables in Formula Nodes
</h1>
<p class="Body">Formula Nodes use the same scope rules for declaring variables as C.
</p>
<ul>

<li>All variables you declare in bracketed blocks are only accessible within the bracketed block.
</li>
<li>All input terminals are considered variables at the outermost block (not enclosed in brackets), and cannot be declared again in the outermost block.
</li>
<li>LabVIEW tries to match variables you declare at the outermost block (not enclosed in brackets) to output terminals with the same name.
</li>
<li>You can declare output terminals that have no corresponding input terminal and are not declared at the outermost block.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Use the correct Formula Node syntax when declaring variables.
</p>

<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use Formula Node most effectively if you are familiar with the C programming language. <em>LabVIEW Help</em> assumes you are familiar with C and does not contain any topics related to programming in C. Refer to <em>The C Programming Language</em> by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie or <em>Teach Yourself C</em> by Herbert Schildt for more information.</td>
