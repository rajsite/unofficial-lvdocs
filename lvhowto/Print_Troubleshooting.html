<h1>Troubleshooting Printer Errors</h1>

<p class="Body">Use the following techniques to find solutions to errors you might encounter when printing from LabVIEW.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a different method of printing. On the <a href="../lvdialog/Printing_Options.html">Printing</a> page of the <strong>Options</strong> dialog box, you can select standard, PostScript, or bitmap methods of printing, depending on the operating system you use.
</li>
<li>Check printer driver information. Printing problems can occur because of errors in the printer driver. Contact the printer manufacturer for the most current version of the printer driver. 
</li>
<li>Use a different computer and/or a different printer. 
</li>
<li>Verify that the printer accepts the page margins you set. Incorrect page margins can cause problems, such as a print job disappearing from the print queue before producing output.
</li>
<li>Change video settings and check the video driver. Screen resolution and color depth settings can affect print jobs. Contact the manufacturer of the graphics card for the most current version of the video driver.
</li>
<li><span class="Platform">(macOS)</span> Allocate more memory to LabVIEW.
</li>
<li>Generate <a href="Creating_HTML_Documents_fo.html">HTML</a> or <a href="Creating_RTF_based_Documen.html">RTF</a> documentation and use a Web browser or word processing application to print the document.
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="../lvreport/Report_Gen_VIs.html">Report Generation VIs</a> to create, manipulate, and print reports programmatically. 
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">
If text on labels and front panel controls clips when you print VIs, the font for the printer does not match the size of the font on the monitor. Use one of the following techniques to prevent clipped control and label text in VI printouts:
</p>
<ul><li>Use the PostScript printer driver for your printer if the printer supports PostScript language.</li>
<li>Enlarge the labels and front panel controls so that when the text expands because of a font mismatch the text still fits in the control or label boundary.</li>
<li>Find a font that is the same size on both the monitor and the printer. Many printer drivers have font substitution algorithms to assist this process.</li>
<li><span class="Platform">(Windows)</span> Use bitmap printing to make the printout exactly match what you see on the monitor.</li></ul>
