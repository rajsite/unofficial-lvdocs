<h1>Caveats and Recommendations when Using Events in LabVIEW
</h1> 
<p class="Body">Because LabVIEW is a graphical programming interface, handling events is different from handling events in other programming languages. The following list describes some of the caveats and recommendations when incorporating events into LabVIEW applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that <a href="../lvhowto/Event_Struct_Outside_Loop.html">Event structures can handle events whenever events occur</a>.
</li>
<li>Remember to <a href="../lvhowto/LatchBooleanEvent.html">read the terminal of a latched Boolean control</a> in its Value Change event case.
</li>
<li>Use a Case structure to <a href="../lvhowto/LatchBooleanEvent.html">handle undo operations for a latched Boolean control</a>.</li>
<li>Use caution when you <a href="../lvhowto/OneCaseHndlMultNotfyEvnt.html">configure one case to handle multiple notify events</a>.
</li>
<li>You cannot <a href="../lvhowto/OneCaseHndlMultFiltEvnt.html">configure one case to handle multiple filter events</a> with different event data.
</li>
<li>If a While Loop that contains an Event structure terminates based on the value of a latched stop Boolean control, remember to <a href="../lvhowto/HndlStopLoopBool.html">handle the latched stop Boolean control</a> in the Event structure.
</li>
<li>Consider <a href="../lvhowto/EvntsVsWaitFPAct.html">using the Wait for Front Panel Activity function</a> if you do not need to monitor specific front panel objects programmatically.
</li>
<li>User interface events apply only to <a href="../lvhowto/EventsDirectUIOnly.html">direct user interaction</a>.
</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="../lvhowto/PromptUserwithDbox.html">using dialog boxes</a> in an event case with the Mouse Down? filter event.
</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="../lvhowto/TwoEvntStrctOneLp.html">placing two Event structures in one loop</a>.
</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="../lvhowto/Use_One_Event_Struct.html">using multiple Event structures</a> in the same VI.</li>
<li><!--start parent = ../glang/Register_Events.html tag="dynamic_registration"-->When using <a href="../lvhowto/Dynamic_Register_Event.html">dynamic registration</a>, make sure you have a Register For Events function for each Event structure.<!--end parent = ../glang/Register_Events.html tag="dynamic_registration"-->
</li>
<li>If you register for the same event on both a VI and a Control class, LabVIEW generates the VI event first.</li>
<li>When <a href="../lvhowto/Using_Events_and_Subpanels.html">using subpanel controls</a>, the top-level VI containing the subpanel control handles the event.</li>
<li>If you need to generate or handle other events while handling the current event, consider using the <a href="../lvcomm/Reg_Event_CallBack.html">Register Event Callback</a> function.</li>
<li>Use caution when selecting between a <a href="../lvconcepts/Notify_and_Filter_Events.html">notify or filter event</a>. An event case configured to handle a notify event cannot affect if or how LabVIEW processes a user interaction. If you want to modify if or how LabVIEW processes a user interaction, use a filter event.</li>
<li>Do not use the <a href="../lvprop/VI_Pnl_Closing.html">Panel Close</a> notify event for important shutdown code unless you have taken steps to ensure that the VI does not abort when the panel closes. For example, be sure the application <a href="../lvconcepts/Dynamic_LoadCall_VIs.html">opens a reference</a> to the VI before a user can close the front panel. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="../lvprop/VI_Panel_CloseQ.html">Panel Close?</a> filter event, which occurs before the panel actually closes.</li>
<li>If no Event structure executes promptly to handle an event and <a href="../lvhowto/Lock_FP.html">front panel locking</a> is enabled, the user interface of the VI may become unresponsive. You must ensure that the Event structure is in a loop that runs often enough to respond to <a href="../lvconcepts/What_Are_Events.html">user interface events</a> in a timely manner or disable front panel locking.</li>
</ul>
