<h1>Managing Breakpoints
</h1>
<!-- begin parent: ../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html -->
<p class="Body">Use the <a href="../glang/Tools_Palette_Icons.html">Breakpoint</a> tool to place a breakpoint on a VI, node, or wire and pause execution at that location. When you set a breakpoint on a wire, execution pauses after data passes through the wire and the <strong>Pause</strong> button appears red. Place a breakpoint on the block diagram to pause execution after all nodes on the block diagram execute. The block diagram border appears red and blinks to reflect the placement of a breakpoint.

<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="Platform">(MathScript RT Module)</span> You also can set a breakpoint on a line of script in a <a href="../gmath/MathScript_Node.html">MathScript Node</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">When a VI pauses at a breakpoint, LabVIEW brings the block diagram to the front and uses a marquee to <a href="../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html#How_LabVIEW_Highlights_Breakpoints">highlight</a> the node or wire that contains the breakpoint. When you move the cursor over an existing breakpoint, the black area of the Breakpoint tool cursor appears white.

<h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to place a breakpoint on a VI, node, or wire and pause execution at that location.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Breakpoint tool <img src="noloc_env_brkpoint.gif"> to click the VI, node, or wire where you want to pause execution. You also can right-click the VI, node, or wire and select <strong>Breakpoint&#0187;Set Breakpoint</strong> from the shortcut menu.
</li>
</ol>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif" alt="Note"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="Platform">(MathScript RT Module)</span> You cannot place breakpoints on certain lines of script in MathScript Nodes. For example, you cannot place a breakpoint on the line <span class="Monospace">a = 1;</span>. If you try to place a breakpoint on a line of script that does not support breakpoints, LabVIEW automatically moves the breakpoint to the next line that supports breakpoints.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run the VI. <!-- begin parent: ../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html -->When you reach a breakpoint during execution, the VI pauses and the <strong>Pause</strong> button appears red. Also, the VI background and border begin blinking. You can take the following actions:

<ul>
<li><a href="Single_Step_Mode.html">Single-step</a> through execution using the single-stepping buttons.
</li>
<li>Check intermediate values on <a href="../lvhowto/Using_the_Probe_Tool.html">probes</a> that you placed on wires prior to running the VI. 
</li>
<li>Check intermediate values on probes that you place after running the VI if you have enabled the <a href="../lvhowto/Retain_Wire_Values.html">Retain Wire Values</a> option.
</li>
<li>Change values of front panel controls.
</li>
<li>Check the <a href="../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html#Suspending_Execution">Call list</a> pull-down menu to see the list of VIs that call the VI that is stopped at a breakpoint.</li>
<li>Click the <a href="../glang/LabVIEW_Toolbar.html">Pause button</a> to continue running to the next breakpoint or until the VI finishes running.
</li>
<!-- end parent: ../lvconcepts/Debug_Techniques.html -->
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Disabling and Enabling Breakpoints</h2>
<p class="Body">To disable a breakpoint so the VI continues executing when LabVIEW reaches the breakpoint, right-click an object with a breakpoint and select <strong>Breakpoint&#0187;Disable Breakpoint</strong> from the shortcut menu. To enable a breakpoint that you previously disabled, right-click the block diagram object and select <strong>Breakpoint&#0187;Enable Breakpoint</strong> from the shortcut menu. You also can disable or enable breakpoints individually or all at once using the <a href="../lvdialog/Breakpoint_Manager.html">Breakpoint Manager</a> window.</p>

<h2>Removing Breakpoints</h2>
<p class="Body">Use the Breakpoint tool to click an existing breakpoint to remove it. You also can right-click a breakpoint using the <a href="../glang/Tools_Palette_Icons.html">Positioning</a> tool and select <strong>Breakpoint&#0187;Clear Breakpoint</strong> from the shortcut menu to remove it. To remove all breakpoints in the VI hierarchy, select <strong>Edit&#0187;Remove Breakpoints from Hierarchy</strong>. You also can remove all breakpoints in the VI hierarchy using the <strong>Breakpoint Manager</strong> window.</p>

<!-- Begin parent: ../glang/Edit_Menu.html -->
<p class="Body">You must manually remove breakpoints in dynamically called VIs or VIs referenced by the <a href="../glang/Static_VI_Ref.html">Static VI Reference</a> function.</p><!-- End parent: ../glang/Edit_Menu.html -->

<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot view breakpoints on a password-protected block diagram if you do not know the password, but you can enable, disable, and remove breakpoints.
