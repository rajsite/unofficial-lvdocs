<p class="Body">You can use <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_Source_Code.html">source control</a> to share software projects between multiple developers. If you check out a file, make changes, and check in the updated file, the updated file replaces the master copy and becomes available to the other developers. However, if you check out a file that is currently checked out by another developer, any change you make to the file will have to be merged with the changes the other developer makes before an updated master copy is saved.</p>
