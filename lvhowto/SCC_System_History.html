<h1>Viewing Revision History in Source Control</h1>

<p class="Body">You can view a brief summary of transactions for a file in source control.
</p>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to view the history for a file in source control.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are in a LabVIEW project, select a file for which you want to view the source control history. If you are working on an individual VI outside a project, open the VI.
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Tools&#0187;Source Control&#0187;Show History</strong> to display a provider-specific dialog box that contains a list of changes made to the file after it was added to source control. Depending on the source control provider, the information in the list might include the number of revisions, the users who made the changes, dates of the changes, and any comments attached to the revisions.
</li>
<li>Close the dialog box.
</li></ol>
