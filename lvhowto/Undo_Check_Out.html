<h1>Undoing File Check-out from Source Control</h1>

<p class="Body">You can undo a file <a href="Checking_Out_Files.html">check-out operation</a> if you want to undo changes you made after you checked out a file. The source control provider retains no record of the check-out operation or the changes you made.
</p>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to undo file check out.
</p>
<ol><li>If you are working in a LabVIEW project, right-click the file or files for which you want to undo the check-out operation and select <strong>Undo Check Out</strong> from the shortcut menu. You also can click the <strong>Undo Check Out</strong> button on the <a href="../glang/Source_Control_Toolbar.html">Source Control toolbar</a> or select <strong>Tools&#0187;Source Control&#0187;Undo Check Out</strong>.
<br><br>
If you are working on individual VIs outside a project, open the VI for which you want to undo the check-out operation. Select <strong>Tools&#0187;Source Control&#0187;Undo Check Out</strong>.
</li>
<li>If you are working in a project, notice that the red checkmark in the file icon disappears <img src="noloc_env_scc_inscc_o.gif"> because the file is no longer checked out of source control.
</li></ol>
