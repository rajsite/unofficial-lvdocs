<h1>Showing Differences between Two Compared VIs</h1>

<p class="Body">Use the <a href="../lvdialog/Differences_Dialog_Box.html">Differences</a> dialog box, available in the LabVIEW Professional Development System, to show the front panels and block diagrams of two <a href="Comparing_VIs.html">compared VIs</a>. After you compare two VIs, open the <strong>Differences</strong> dialog box by selecting <strong>Tools&#0187;Compare&#0187;Show Differences</strong> from the front panel or block diagram menu of a VI.</p>

<p class="Body">You also can access the dialog box by clicking the <strong>Show Differences</strong> button in the <a href="../lvdialog/Compare_Hierarchies_Dialog.html">Compare VI Hierarchies</a> dialog box.</p>

<p class="Body">The <strong>Differences</strong> dialog box includes a list of differences and details of the selected difference. </p>

<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to selectively find differences between the front panels and block diagrams of two compared VIs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-click an item in the differences list or select an item and click the <strong>Show Difference</strong> button to highlight a difference.<br><br>
To highlight a detail, double-click an item in the details list or select an item and click the <strong>Show Detail</strong> button. A checkmark indicates the items you selected.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Tile Left and Right</strong> or <strong>Tile Up and Down</strong> button to tile the windows of the two VIs you are comparing.</li>
<li>If you have made edits after comparing your VIs, some of the differences might no longer exist. Click the <strong>Update</strong> button to compare the two VIs again and update the differences list.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Clear</strong> button to clear the differences list.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Body">Place a checkmark in the <strong>Circle differences</strong> checkbox to draw a red circle around the object or objects that have changed. When you highlight a difference, objects that are part of the difference are selected. The following illustration shows an example of a block diagram difference.</p>

<p class="Anchor"><img src="loc_bd_shodiff2.gif"></p>

<p class="Body">In the illustration, the circled objects have been inserted into the second VI. Objects selected but not circled are not different. They are selected as anchor objects to provide reference points for the difference. Objects that appear dimmed are not part of the difference.  This comparison checked for differences in <strong>VI attributes</strong> and <strong>Cosmetic changes</strong> on the block diagram but not <strong>Position/size changes</strong>.</p>
