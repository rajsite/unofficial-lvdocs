<h1>Displaying a Signal
</h1>
<p class="Body">After you <a href="Acquiring_Signals.html">acquire or simulate</a> a signal, you can display it in a graph, chart, or numeric indicator. Many Express VIs, such as the <a href="../lvexpress/Simulate_Signal.html">Simulate Signal</a>, the DAQ Assistant, and <a href="../lvexpress/Signal_Analysis_Exp_VIs.html">Signal Analysis</a> Express VIs, include a <strong>Signals</strong> output that you can wire to a graph, chart, or numeric indicator, such as a thermometer or digital display.
</p>  
<p class="Body">The indicator you choose depends on the type of signal. For example, if you acquire a single temperature, display the temperature in a thermometer or digital display. If you acquire several temperatures over a period of time, display those temperatures in a chart. If you acquire waveform signals, display those signals in a graph because waveforms, such as sine waves and sawtooth waves, include timing information and corresponding values.
</p>  
<p class="Body">You can configure the graph to automatically name the plot the same name as its signal type in the plot legend. For example, if you acquire or simulate a sine wave and wire the <strong>Signals</strong> output to a graph, the plot name for the signal appears as <span class="Monospace-Bold">Sine</span> in the plot legend.
