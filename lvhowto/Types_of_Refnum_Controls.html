<h1>Types of Refnum Controls
</h1>
<p class="Body">LabVIEW includes the following <a href="Refnum_Controls_and_Indica.html">refnum controls</a> located on the <strong>Refnum</strong> palette:
</p>

<table class="Borderless">
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_dotnetref.gif"></td><td><strong>.NET Refnum</strong>&#8212;Use this refnum to launch the <a href="../lvdialog/Select_Net_ConstDB.html">Select .NET Constructor</a> dialog box and select an assembly in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) or navigate to a private assembly.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_appref.gif"></td><td><strong>Application Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the VI Server. Use this refnum control when you open a reference to a LabVIEW application and you want to pass the reference as a parameter to another VI. By passing this refnum to the VI Server, you can control the behavior and read properties of the application.
<br><br>
You can right-click an application refnum control and select <strong>Select VI Server Class</strong> from the shortcut menu to change the data type of the control&#8212;an application, a VI, a control or indicator, or a strictly typed VI.
<br><br>
You can drag any control and drop it on an application refnum to specify the type of control to which it refers.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_autoref.gif"></td><td><strong>Automation Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../lvcomm/ActiveX_Client_Functions.html">ActiveX</a> functions. Use this type of refnum when you open a reference to an ActiveX Server Object and you want to pass it as a parameter to another VI. To specify the type of the refnum, right-click it and select <strong>Select ActiveX Class&#0187;Browse</strong> from the shortcut menu to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Select_Obj_From_Type_Lib.html">Select Object From Type Library</a> dialog box and browse the list of available ActiveX Server applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_bt_refnum.gif"></td><td><strong>Bluetooth Network Connection Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../lvcomm/Bluetooth_VIs.html">Bluetooth</a> VIs and functions. Use this type of refnum to open a connection to a Bluetooth device.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_byteref.gif"></td><td><strong>Byte Stream File Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with text or binary byte stream files. Use this type of refnum when you open or create a file in one VI but want to perform I/O operations on the file in another VI. You must have a refnum control on the front panel of the VI that performs I/O operations and a refnum indicator on the front panel of the VI that opens or creates the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_cntrlref.gif"></td><td><strong>Control Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the VI Server. Use this refnum control when you open a reference to a front panel control or indicator and you want to pass the reference as a parameter to another VI. By passing this refnum to the VI Server, you can control the behavior and properties of the control.
<br><br>
You can right-click a control refnum control and select <strong>Select VI Server Class</strong> from the shortcut menu to specify the data type of the control&#8212;an application, a VI, a control or indicator, or a strictly typed VI.
<br><br>
Right-click a control refnum control on the front panel and select <strong>Show Icon</strong> from the shortcut menu to view the refnum as an icon. Right-click the refnum on the front panel and select <strong>Show Control</strong> on the shortcut menu to view the refnum as a control. Note that the control is for display only.
<br><br>
You can drag any control and drop it on a control refnum to specify the type of control to which it refers.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_dataref.gif"></td><td><strong>Data Log File Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with <a href="../lvconcepts/Creating_Datalog_Files.html">datalog files</a>. Because datalog files have an inherent structure, the Data Log File Refnum passes the refnum and a description of the file type to and from calling VIs. Place a control inside the refnum to define the structure of the file. For a file that contains numbers, create a datalog refnum that contains a number. If each record in the file contains a pair of numbers, place a cluster inside the refnum and place two numeric controls inside the cluster.
<br><br>
You can drag any control and drop it on a data log file refnum to specify the data type of the datalog file.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_dsocref.gif"></td><td><strong>DataSocket Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with <a href="../lvcomm/DataSocket_VI_Reference.html">DataSocket</a> functions. Use this type of refnum when you want to <a href="OpenClose_DS_Conct_Prog.html">open a reference to a data connection</a> and you want to pass it as a parameter to another VI. To specify the type of the refnum, right-click it and select <strong>Select DataSocket Class</strong> from the shortcut menu to browse to the DataSocket class.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_eventref.gif"></td><td><strong>Event Callback Refnum</strong>&#8212;Use this refnum to unregister or re-register the event callback. You also can use this refnum to pass the event callback registration to a subVI.</td>

<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_irdaref.gif"></td><td><strong>IrDA Network Connection Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../lvcomm/IrDA_VIs.html">IrDA</a> functions. Use this type of refnum when you want to open a connection to an IrDA device.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_menuref.gif"></td><td><strong>Menu Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../glang/Menu_Functions.html">Menu</a> functions. Use this type of refnum when you want to pass a VI menu reference to a subVI.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_occurref.gif"></td><td><strong>Occurrence Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../glang/Occurrence_Functions.html">Occurrence</a> functions. Use this type of refnum when you generate an occurrence in one VI but want to set or wait for the occurrence in another VI.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_netref.gif"></td><td><strong>TCP Network Connection Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../lvcomm/TCP_VI_Descriptions.html">TCP</a> VIs and functions.

<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_udpref.gif"></td><td><strong>UDP Network Connection Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the <a href="../lvcomm/UDP_VI_Descriptions.html">UDP</a> VI and functions. Use this type of refnum when you want to uniquely identify a UDP socket. You can pass the UDP socket reference to a subVI so the subVI can use the socket.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="Icon"><img src="noloc_env_viref.gif"></td><td><strong>VI Refnum</strong>&#8212;Used with the VI Server. Use this refnum control when you open a reference to a VI and you want to pass the reference as a parameter to another VI. By passing this refnum to the VI Server, you can control the behavior and properties of the VI. 
<br><br>
Use VI refnum controls to pass a VI refnum from one VI to another. The Open VI Reference function requires a <a href="create_strict_type_refnum.html">strictly typed VI refnum control</a> as a type specifier input when you want a strictly typed reference to a VI. In this case, the value of the refnum control is unimportant. The function uses only the  type.
<br><br>
You can drag any control and drop it on a VI refnum to specify the type of control to which it refers.</td>
