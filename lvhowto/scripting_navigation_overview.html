<h1>Navigating a VI Using VI Scripting</h1>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> <a href="enabling_vi_scripting.html">VI Scripting</a></p>
<p>Because block diagram objects in a VI are connected by terminals and wires, you can use a reference to one object to gain access to other connected objects. You can use this strategy of navigating a target VI in the following situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Inspecting or editing connections among objects</li>
		<li>Obtaining a reference to an object that you cannot access directly with the <a href="../glang/Open_VI_Object_Reference.html">Open VI Object Reference</a> function or the Traverse for GObjects VI</li>
	</ul>
<p>If you can connect objects together manually in LabVIEW, LabVIEW most likely provides a property or method that allows you to navigate those connections programmatically. Therefore, all navigation tasks involve obtaining a reference to a starting object and then using the necessary properties and methods to obtain references to the connected objects. You can segment large navigation tasks into the following navigation subtasks:</p>
<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifying a starting point from which to navigate</li>
		<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_node_to_wire.html">Navigating from a node to a wire</a></li>
		<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_wire_to_node.html">Navigating from a wire to a node</a></li>
		<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_structures.html">Navigating across a structure</a></li>
		<li>Navigating between a block diagram and its front panel</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>The following example demonstrates how you can combine some of the previous navigation subtasks to solve a larger navigation problem.</p>
	
<a name="illustrative"></a><h2>Example Task: Preserving Wiring when Replacing a Function</h2>
<p>You can write a scripting VI that replaces a One Button Dialog function with a Two Button Dialog function in any target VI. However, after making this replacement, you must ensure that the object that was wired to the <strong>button name</strong> input of the One Button Dialog function is wired to the <strong>T button name</strong> input of the new Two Button Dialog function. The following images illustrate the desired change.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Before</td>
		<td>After</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td><img src="loc_bd_navigation_terms_target2.gif"></td>
		<td><img src="loc_bd_nav_target_two_button.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Why This Example Task Requires Navigation</h3>
<p>To replace the One Button Dialog function, you need only a reference to the function. However, to ensure that the original wiring persists to the new Two Button Dialog function, you also require a reference to the object that is wired to the <strong>button name</strong> input of the One Button Dialog function. You can obtain this string reference by navigating the connections between the One Button Dialog function and the connected object.</p>

<h3>How to Use Navigation to Complete This Example Task</h3>
<p>The following outline highlights the navigation subtasks that are necessary to navigate from the One Button Dialog function to the object wired to its <strong>button name</strong> input. Refer to the individual task topics for specific information about how to implement each task.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Identify a starting point for navigation</strong>&#8212;You can use the One Button Dialog function as the starting point for navigation because you know that all target VIs of interest have a One Button Dialog function.</li>
	<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_node_to_wire.html">Navigate from a node to a wire</a>&#8212;You can use the reference to the One Button Dialog function to obtain a reference to the wire that connects to the <strong>button name</strong> input of the function.</li>
	<li><a href="../lvhowto/scripting_nav_wire_to_node.html">Navigate from a wire to a node</a>&#8212;You can use the wire reference to obtain a reference to its source node.</li>
</ol>
<p>After completing these three navigation tasks, you have access to all the references you need to complete the task. </p>
