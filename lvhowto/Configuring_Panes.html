<h1>Configuring Panes</h1>
<p class="Body">You can use splitter bars to create professional user interfaces, such as toolbars or status bars. By adding splitter bars to the front panel, you separate the front panel into multiple regions, called panes. Each pane acts similar to a unique front panel. You can scroll each pane individually. Each pane has its own set of controls on it. The splitter bar can separate the controls on one pane from those on another pane, yet the terminals for all controls are on the same block diagram.  You can configure panes by right-clicking the visible scroll bar and selecting options from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p class="Body">You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/Pane_p.html">Pane</a> properties to configure panes programmatically.</p>
