<h1>Using Supplied Probes
</h1>
<p class="Body"><!--begin parent: 3500debugging/hlp-->Use supplied probes to display comprehensive information about the data that flows through a wire.<!--end parent: 3500debugging/hlp--> You also can use a supplied probe to respond based on the data that flows through the wire.
</p>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to use a supplied probe.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click a wire and select <strong>Custom Probe</strong> from the shortcut menu.
</li>
<li>Select among the following supplied probes. All supplied probes that match the data type of the wire you right-clicked appear at the top of the shortcut menu.
<ul>
<li><strong>.NET Refnum Probe</strong>&#8212;Displays the result of calling the ToString() method on the object represented by the .NET refnum, the type of the object, the hash code of the object, and the hex value of the reference. You can use this probe to set a breakpoint if the value is an invalid refnum.
</li>
<li><strong>Analog Waveform Probe (DBL)</strong>&#8212;Displays a graph of the analog data; a table with a time stamp that specifies when the probe received the data, the <span class="Monospace">x</span> value, and the time; and a table that displays the attributes of the waveform data.

<p class="Body">After you select a probe, <!--Begin parent: ../lvconcepts/Building_the_Block_Diagram.xml-->that probe becomes the default probe for that data type, and LabVIEW loads that probe when you right-click the wire and select <strong>Probe</strong> from the shortcut menu.<!--End parent: ../lvconcepts/Building_the_Block_Diagram.xml-->
</p>
<p class="Body">You can <a href="Creating_Custom_Probes.html">create a new probe based on a supplied probe</a> and add it to the <strong>Custom Probe</strong> shortcut menu.
