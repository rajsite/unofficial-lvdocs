<h1>Switching Between Strictly Typed and Weakly Typed Control Refnums
</h1>
<p class="Body"><!--begin parent=../lvconcepts/Programmatically_Controlling_VIs.xml NK-->Strictly typed control refnums accept only control refnums of exactly the same data type. <a href="../lvconcepts/Controlling_Front_Panel_Objects.html#Strictly_Typed_and_Weakly_Typed_Control_Refnums">Weakly typed control refnums</a> are more flexible in the type of data they accept.<!--end parent=../lvconcepts/Programmatically_Controlling_VIs.xml NK--></p>

<p class="Body">There are five ways to switch between a strictly typed control refnum and a weakly typed control refnum.</p>
<ul>

<li>Right-click a strictly typed control refnum and remove the checkbox from the <strong>Include Data Type</strong> item in the shortcut menu to make it weakly typed.</li>

<li>Right-click a weakly typed control refnum and select <strong>Include Data Type</strong> from the shortcut menu to make it strictly typed. This method does not work when the class of data is too general, such as GObject or General.</li>

<li>Right-click a strictly typed control refnum and select <strong>Select Ctrl Type</strong> from the shortcut menu to change the class and disable the <strong>Include Data Type</strong> option, which makes the control refnum weakly typed.</li>

<li>Right-click a strictly typed control refnum and select <strong>Select VI Server Class</strong> from the shortcut menu to select a generic control class, such as <strong>Generic</strong>, <strong>GObject&#0187;GObject</strong>, or <strong>GObject&#0187;Control&#0187;Control</strong>. Generic control classes cannot be strictly typed.</li>

<li>Drag a control into the front panel control refnum control to remove the original control and create a strictly typed control refnum. A red star in the lower left corner of the control refnum control indicates the control reference is strictly typed. Press the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key as you drag a control into the control refnum control to keep the original control and create a strictly typed control refnum. <span class="Platform">(macOS)</span> Press the &lt;Option&gt; key. <span class="Platform">(Linux)</span> Press the &lt;Alt&gt; key.</li>

</ul>
