<p class="Body">
					
					You develop LabVIEW VIs that run on Windows Embedded Standard targets by adding a target to a LabVIEW project. When you run the VI from the host computer, or host VI, the VI compiles and runs on the target. The host VI accesses the data on the target and displays the data on the front panel.</p><a name="Unsupported_Features_WES"></a><h2>Unsupported LabVIEW Features</h2>
<p class="Body">
					During remote development, certain LabVIEW features are not supported for VIs that run on Windows Embedded Standard targets. If you attempt to run on a Windows Embedded Standard target a VI that has unsupported functionality, the VI might still execute. However, the unsupported functions do not work and may return standard LabVIEW error codes.</p>
<p class="Body">The following features are not supported on Windows Embedded Standard targets during remote development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subpanel controls</li>
<li>Debugging reentrant VIs</li>
<li>XControls</li>
</ul><a name="troubleshoot_WES"></a><h2>Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
<p class="Body">Use the following table to find solutions when using LabVIEW Remote Development Target Support and developing applications on a Windows Embedded Standard target.</p>
<table class="Bordered">

<td class="Bordered">Ensure that the target meets the requirements necessary to discover a device for remote development:<br><ul>
<li>A user with administrator privileges is logged into the target.</li>
<li>LabVIEW Remote Development is enabled on the target.</li>

<td class="Bordered">From the host computer, you can configure remote development settings by completing the following steps:
						<ol>
<li>On the host computer, open a Web browser and enter the following URL to access the NI Web-based Configuration &amp; Monitoring application: <span class="Monospace">http://localhost:3582</span>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Network Browser</strong> button on the left and double-click the row that contains your target. A separate NI Web-based Configuration &amp; Monitoring application specific to your target opens in a Web browser.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Login</strong> in the top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Enter <span class="Monospace">Admin</span> in the <strong>User name</strong> field.</li>
<li>Leave the <strong>Password</strong> field blank. The default password is blank. Set the password to establish security.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>System Configuration</strong> page, configure the remote development settings for your target.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save changes.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Restart</strong> in the top-right corner of the page to restart the target. You must log into the target for changes to take effect.</li>
