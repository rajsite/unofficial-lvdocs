<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				LabVIEW supports several low-level protocols you can use to communicate between computers.
			</p>
<p class="Body">Each protocol is different, especially in the way it refers to the network location of a remote application. Each protocol generally is incompatible with other protocols. For example, if you want to communicate between macOS and Windows, you must use a protocol that works on both platforms, such as TCP.</p><a name="TCP_and_UDP"></a><h2>TCP and UDP</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (<a href="Using_LabVIEW_with_TCP_IP_and_UDP.html#UDP">UDP</a>) are available on all platforms LabVIEW supports. TCP is a reliable, connection-based protocol. It provides error detection and ensures that data arrive in order and without duplication. For these reasons, TCP is usually the best choice for network applications.</p>
<p class="Body">Although UDP can give higher performance than TCP and does not require a connection, it does not guarantee delivery. Typically, use UDP in applications in which guaranteed delivery is not critical. For example, an application might transmit data to a destination frequently enough that a few lost segments of data are not problematic.</p>
<p class="Body">
				Use the <a href="../lvcomm/UDP_Multicast_Open.html">UDP Multicast Open</a> VI instead of the <a href="../lvcomm/UDP_Open.html">UDP Open</a> function to open connections capable of reading, writing, or reading and writing UDP data to or from a multicast IP address. A multicast IP address defines a multicast group. Multicast IP addresses are in the <span class="Monospace">224.0.0.0</span> to <span class="Monospace">239.255.255.255</span> range. When a client wants to join a multicast group, it subscribes to the multicast IP address of the group. After the client subscribes to a multicast group, the client receives data sent to the multicast IP address.
			</p><a name="Apple_Events_Mac_OS"></a><h2>Running AppleScript Code (macOS)</h2>
<p class="Body">
					
				
				
AppleScript is a scripting language that enables you to control macOS applications as well as different parts of the OS. Use the <a href="../glang/run_applescript_code.html">Run AppleScript Code</a> VI to request actions or return information from macOS applications external to LabVIEW using AppleScript code.</p><a name="Pipe_VIs_Linux"></a><h2>Pipe VIs (Linux)</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				Use the <a href="../lvcomm/Named_Pipe_VIs_UNIX.html">Pipes</a> VIs to open, close, read, and write to Linux named pipes. Use named pipes to communicate between LabVIEW and unrelated processes.</p><a name="Executing_System-Level_Commands_Windows_and_Linux"></a><h2>Executing System-Level Commands (Windows and Linux)</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				Use the <a href="../glang/System_Exec.html">System Exec</a> VI to execute or launch other Windows-based applications or Linux command-line applications from within VIs. With the System Exec VI, you execute a system-level command line that can include any parameters supported by the application you want to launch.
