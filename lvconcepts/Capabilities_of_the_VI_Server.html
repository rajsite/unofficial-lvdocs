<p class="Body">
					
					The VI Server is a set of functions that allows you to dynamically control front panel objects, VIs, and the LabVIEW environment. These functions are located on the <a href="../glang/Appl_Control_VI_and_Func.html">Application Control</a> palette. Use the VI Server to perform the following programmatic operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../lvconcepts/Dynamic_LoadCall_VIs.html">Dynamically load VIs</a> into memory when another VI needs to call them, rather than loading all subVIs when you open a VI. </li>
<li>
						
						
						Call a VI remotely.</li>
<li>
						
						Configure a LabVIEW <a href="Application_Instances.html">application instance</a> to be a server that exports VIs you can call from other instances of LabVIEW on the Web. For example, if you have a data acquisition application that acquires and logs data at a remote site, you can sample that data occasionally from your local computer. By changing the VI Server preferences in the <a href="../lvdialog/Options_Dialog_Box.html">Options</a> dialog box, you can make some VIs accessible on the Web so that transferring the latest data is as easy as a dynamic VI call. The VI Server handles the networking details. The VI Server also works across platforms, so the client and the server can run on different platforms. </li>
<li>Edit the <a href="../lvdialog/VI_Properties_Dialog_Box.html">properties of a VI</a> and LabVIEW. For example, you can dynamically determine the location of a VI window or scroll a front panel so that a part of it is visible. You also can programmatically save any changes to disk. </li>
<li>Update the properties of multiple VIs rather than manually using the <a href="../lvdialog/VI_Properties_Dialog_Box.html">VI Properties</a> dialog box for each VI. </li>
<li>Retrieve information about an application instance, such as the version number and edition. You also can retrieve environment information, such as the platform on which LabVIEW is running.</li>
<li>Create a plug-in architecture for the application to add functionality to the application after you distribute it to customers. For example, you might have a set of data filtering VIs, all of which take the same parameters. By designing the application to dynamically load these VIs from a plug-in directory, you can ship the application with a partial set of these VIs and make more filtering options available to users by placing the new filtering VIs in the plug-in directory.</li>
