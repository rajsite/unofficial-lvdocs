</noscript><h1>Managing Build Specifications</h1>
<p class="Body">
			After you configure build specifications in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window, LabVIEW provides ways to manage and track your build specifications. Keeping track of your build specifications throughout development can help improve your development cycle. 
			</p>
<p class="Body">LabVIEW also provides functionality when working with your build specifications inside the project. You can duplicate build specifications in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window. Right-click the build specification item you want to duplicate and select <strong>Duplicate</strong> from the shortcut menu to create a copy of the build specification item.	
					</p>
<p class="Body">You also can drag and drop build specification items to rearrange the build order within the same build specification. 
				</p>
<p class="Body">To delete the build specification files that LabVIEW creates during the most recent build, right-click the build specification and select <strong>Clean</strong> from the shortcut menu. Selecting <strong>Clean</strong> does not delete files that LabVIEW creates before the most recent build. You also can use the <a href="../glang/clean_vi.html">Clean</a> VI to delete files from the most recent build.</p>
<p class="Body">If you build a stand-alone application, you can copy your LabVIEW work environment options into the build.</p>
