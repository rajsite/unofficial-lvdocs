</noscript><h1>Organizing Network Stream Endpoint Names</h1>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				You can organize endpoints by adding segments to their names that describe the data they stream, the computer on which they reside, or other characteristics. When you have multiple endpoints on different computers, organizing endpoints in this way helps ensure that you connect each writer endpoint to its corresponding reader endpoint.</p>
<p class="Body">Complete the following steps to organize endpoints by name.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wire the <strong>writer name</strong> terminal of the <a href="../lvcomm/NS_CreateWriter.html">Create Network Stream Writer Endpoint</a> function or the <strong>reader name</strong> terminal of the <a href="../lvcomm/NS_CreateReader.html">Create Network Stream Reader Endpoint</a> function.</li>
<li>Place a slash between each segment of the name that you specify in these terminals.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body">For example, assume you have three writer endpoints within the same application on a real-time (RT) target. One measures temperature, and the other two measure voltage signals. These endpoints connect to three corresponding reader endpoints in an application on a desktop computer. The following figure shows examples of names that you could assign to each endpoint. The arrows indicate the reader endpoint to which each writer endpoint connects.</p>
<p class="Anchor"><img src="loc_bd_endpointnames.gif"></p>
<p class="Body">In the figure above, the name of each endpoint describes the target the endpoint resides on, the type of data the endpoint streams, and whether the endpoint reads or writes that data. This naming scheme shows which endpoints correspond with each other.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��The name of one endpoint cannot be the partial name of another endpoint within the same application. For instance, in the above example, if you name one of the writer endpoints <span class="Monospace">RT Target/Voltage</span> and the other <span class="Monospace">RT Target/Voltage/Writer 1</span>, these endpoints will return an error instead of creating network streams.</td>
