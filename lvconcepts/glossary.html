Therefore, this noise is a common-mode voltage signal that is rejected by an amount equal to the CMRR of the instrument. The CMRR is defined by the following equation:<br><br> CMRR = 20 log(Differential Gain/Common Mode Gain)<br><br> The ratio is important because it indicates how much of the common mode signal appears in your measurement. The value of the CMRR depends on signal frequency as well and must be specified as a function of frequency. An equivalent equation to represent CMRR is as follows:<br><br> 20 Log(Measured Common Voltage/Applied Common Voltage)<br></td>

<li>A method of compensating for inaccuracies in thermocouple circuits.</li>
<li>An artificial reference level that compensates for ambient temperature variations in thermocouple measurement circuits. IC temperature sensors are linear and their output is expressed as mV/�C. A 10 mV/�C sensor, for example, outputs 250 mV at 25 �C. Thermistor outputs, however, are nonlinear. Therefore, thermistor output is specified as the voltage range over a defined temperature range (x volts at 50 �C to y volts at 0 �C).</li>

The exponential window is useful for analyzing transient response signals whose duration is longer than the length of the window.

By convention, to characterize the shape of the main lobe, the widths of the main lobe at approximately 3 dB and 6 dB below the main lobe peak describe the width of the main lobe. The unit of measure for the main lobe width is FFT bins or frequency lines. The width of the main lobe of the smoothing window spectrum limits the frequency resolution of the windowed signal. Therefore, the ability to distinguish two closely spaced frequency components increases as the main lobe of the smoothing window narrows. As the main lobe narrows and spectral resolution improves, the window energy spreads into its side lobes, increasing spectral leakage and decreasing amplitude accuracy. A trade-off occurs between amplitude accuracy and spectral resolution.
