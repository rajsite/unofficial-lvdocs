<p class="Body">
				
				Windows Vista and later operating systems from Microsoft include additional levels of security, including User Account Control. By prompting the user to enter an administrative password prior to installing applications or completing other tasks, User Account Control helps prevent users from inadvertently introducing viruses or other types of changes that might destabilize the system. Additionally, a user who logs into Windows Vista or later as a standard user can write only to specific locations on disk. Standard user is the default login on these operating systems.</p>
