<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				Use timed structures to monitor and control the timing of your code. Timed structures work best with real-time applications and advanced Windows applications. For other applications, consider using the following objects instead of timed structures. These objects provide you with slightly less control over the timing of your code but require less configuration than timed structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../glang/While_Loop.html">While Loop</a></li>
<li><a href="../glang/Wait_ms.html">Wait (ms) function</a></li>
<li><a href="../glang/Wait_Till_Next_ms_Multiple.html">Wait Until Next ms Multiple function</a></li>
<li><a href="../lvconcepts/Loops_and_Structures.html">Other loops and structures in LabVIEW</a></li>
</ul><a name="Comparing__Timed_Structures"></a><h2>Determining Which Timed Structure to Use</h2>
<p class="Body">If you decide timed structures are appropriate for your application, the following information can help you decide which timed structure to use.</p>
<table class="Bordered">
<tr>
<th class="Bordered">Timed Structure</th>
<th class="Bordered">Purpose of the Structure</th>
<th class="Bordered">Execution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><a href="../glang/Timed_Loop.html">Timed Loop</a></td>
<td class="Bordered">Timed Loops work well for:
						<ul>
<li>Code you want to repeat according to specific timing characteristics</li>
<li>Code that needs to iterate or that has stop conditions</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td class="Bordered">Executes code repeatedly until a stop condition is met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><a href="../lvdialog/Loop_Configuration_Frames_DB.html">Timed Loop with Frames</a></td>
<td class="Bordered">Timed Loops with frames work well for:
						<ul>
<li>Code you want to run in sequence</li>
<li>Large applicationsï¿½You can monitor the timing properties of complex code more easily because you receive timing information for each individual frame.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td class="Bordered">Executes code repeatedly, in sequence, until a stop condition is met. A Timed Loop with frames behaves like a Timed Loop that contains an embedded <a href="sequence_structures_concepts.html">Sequence</a> structure.</td>

<tr>
<td class="Bordered"><a href="../glang/Timed_Sequence.html">Timed Sequence</a></td>
<td class="Bordered">Timed Sequence structures work well for:
						<ul>
<li>Code you want to execute only once with precise timing, execution feedback, timing characteristics that change dynamically, or several levels of execution priority</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td class="Bordered">Executes code in sequence only once. Unlike Timed Loops, Timed Sequence structures do not repeat iterations.</td>
