</noscript><h1>Using Packed Project Libraries in LabVIEW Projects</h1>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				LabVIEW packed project libraries are <a href="Project_Libraries.html">project libraries</a> that package multiple files into a single file with a <span class="Monospace">.lvlibp</span> file extension. The top-level file of a packed library is a project library. By default, the packed library has the same name as the top-level project library.</p>
<p class="Body">You should <a href="../lvhowto/converting_packed_libraries.html">build a packed library from VIs in a LabVIEW project</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you build a stand-alone application, build time is shorter if portions of the stand-alone application are in packed libraries. Because a packed library is a precompiled file, it does not need to compile when you build the stand-alone application, shortening build time.</li>
<li>Because a packed library packages multiple files in a single file, fewer files deploy when you deploy the VIs in a packed library.</li>
<li>VIs that call exported VIs in a packed library can <a href="#Compatibility_Packed_Library">adapt to memory allocation changes</a> so that you do not have to recompile the caller VIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">From the <a href="Using_LabVIEW_Projects.html">Project Explorer</a> window, right-click <strong>Build Specifications</strong> and select <strong>New�Packed Library</strong> from the shortcut menu to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box and configure settings to <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">build a packed library</a>.</p>
<p class="Body">A packed library contains only LabVIEW files. By default, LabVIEW saves non-LabVIEW files to the same destination directory as the packed library. Select <strong>Support Directory</strong> in the <strong>Destinations</strong> list and change the path in the <strong>Destination path</strong> text box to change where LabVIEW saves non-LabVIEW files.</p>
<p class="Body">To <a href="../lvconcepts/replace_item.html">replace a project library</a> with a packed library in a project, right-click the project library and select <strong>Replace with</strong> from the shortcut menu. When you select <strong>Replace with</strong>, all caller VIs of the project library in the LabVIEW project update with the qualified names of the packed library.</p><a name="Exported_VIs_Packed_Project_Library"></a><h2>Exported VIs in a Packed Project Library</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				When you open a packed library, you see only the exported LabVIEW VIs. Exported VIs are VIs in project libraries with a public access scope or VIs in LabVIEW classes with a public or protected <a href="../lvhowto/Setting_Scope_classes.html">access scope</a>.</p>

<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��To create a packed library from a LabVIEW class, add the LabVIEW class to a project library and <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">build a packed library</a> from the project library.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">To find the access scope of a file in a packed library, right-click the file from the project library and select <strong>Access Scope</strong> from the shortcut menu. You cannot change the access scope of files in a packed library unless you make changes from the LabVIEW project and then rebuild the packed library.</p><a name="Packed_Project_Library_Builds"></a><h2>Types of Packed Project Library Builds</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				When you build a packed library, you can create it as a release build or a debug build.</p>
<p class="Body">A release build is the default build for a packed library. Create a packed library as a release build when you do not want to include block diagrams of the VIs in the library. If a VI is not a dialog box, you also can remove front panels on the <a href="../lvdialog/Source_Settings_Packed_Page.html">Source File Settings</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��You cannot debug VIs in a packed library release build because the VIs do not have block diagrams.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">Create a packed library as a debug build when you want to include block diagrams of the VIs. Use a debug build to debug issues in the packed library. Because you cannot save changes to VIs in an existing packed library, save the changes to the original VIs and then rebuild the packed library.</p>
<p class="Body">To create a debug build, place a checkmark in the <strong>Enable Debugging</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/Advanced_Packed_Page.html">Advanced</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box.</p><a name="Compatibility_Packed_Library"></a><h2>Compatibility of Packed Project Libraries and Caller VIs</h2>
<p class="Body">
				The following changes to a VI in a packed library require caller VIs to recompile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the connector pane pattern.</li>
<li>Changing the dynamic dispatch terminal on the connector pane.</li>
<li>Changing an input terminal to an output terminal or an output terminal to an input terminal on the connector pane.</li>
<li>Changing an optional input to required on the connector pane.</li>
<li>Changing the data types of inputs or outputs on the connector pane.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">If a VI calls a packed project library compiled for one target and you open the VI on another target that has a different operating system, the packed project library fails to load.</p>
<p class="Body">If a stand-alone application, a shared library, or a packed library calls a VI in a packed library, include the called packed library in the same directory as the other <a href="../lvconcepts/Building_StandAloneApps.html">build specifications</a>. When a build specification calls a VI in a packed library, you can replace the library with an updated version only if the connector panes of the updated packed library are compatible with the build specification.</p>
<p class="Body">If the connector panes of exported VIs in the packed library are not compatible with a VI in the build specification, rebuild the build specification with the caller VI after you rebuild the library.</p>
<p class="Body">When a change to a VI in a packed library impacts the compatibility of the connector panes, by default the caller VI adapts to the changes, which means that you do not need to recompile the VI that calls the library. If you want the caller VI to recompile, remove the checkmark from the <strong>Callers adapt at run time to Exported VI connector pane state</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/Connector_Pane_Packed_Page.html">Connector Pane State</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box.</p>
<p class="checkFile lvrthelp Body">
				<span class="Platform">(Real-Time Module)</span> When a change to a VI in a packed library impacts the compatibility of the connector panes, by default you need to recompile the VI that calls the library. If you want the caller VI to run without recompiling when you change a VI in a packed library, place a checkmark in the <strong>Callers adapt at run time to Exported VI connector pane state</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/Connector_Pane_Packed_Page.html">Connector Pane State</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box.</p><a name="Project_Library_Properties"></a><h2>Packed Project Library Properties</h2>
<p class="Body">
				The packed library has the same properties as the top-level project library. Because you cannot modify a packed library without rebuilding, you cannot make changes to properties in the <a href="../lvdialog/Library_Props_DB.html">Project Library Properties</a> dialog box. To display the <strong>Project Library Properties</strong> dialog box, open a packed library, right-click the <span class="Monospace">.lvlibp</span> file, and select <strong>Properties</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p class="Body">To update the <a href="../lvdialog/Library_Props_DB.html">Project Library Properties</a> dialog box, make changes to the properties of the top-level project library and rebuild the packed library.</p>

When you create a packed library, the <strong>Version Number</strong> on the <a href="../lvdialog/Version_Info_Packed_Page.html">Version Information</a> page of the <strong>Packed Library Properties</strong> dialog box overrides the <strong>Version Number</strong> on the <a href="../lvdialog/General_Lib_Page.html">General Settings</a> page of the <strong>Project Library Properties</strong> dialog box.</td>
