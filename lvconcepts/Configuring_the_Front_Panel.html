<p class="Body">You can configure a button in a VI to behave like a dialog box button so that pressing the &lt;Enter&gt; key on the alphanumeric keyboard or the &lt;Enter&gt; key on the numeric keypad is the same as clicking the button. If you associate either &lt;Enter&gt; key with a dialog box button, LabVIEW automatically draws that button with a thick border around it.</p>
<p class="Body">If you navigate to a Boolean control and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key, the Boolean control changes, even if another control uses the &lt;Enter&gt; key as its keyboard shortcut.

<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				
				Controls and indicators on a front panel have an order, called tabbing order, that is unrelated to their position on the front panel. LabVIEW determines tabbing order based on the order in which you place controls on the front panel. The first control or indicator you create on the front panel is element 0, the second is 1, and so on. If you delete a control or indicator, the tabbing order adjusts automatically.</p>
<p class="Body">
				The tabbing order determines the order in which LabVIEW selects controls and indicators when the user presses the &lt;Tab&gt; key while a VI runs. The tabbing order also determines the order in which the controls and indicators appear in the records of datalog files you create when you <a href="Logging_Front_Panel_Data.html">log the front panel data</a>.
			</p>
<p class="Body">You can <a href="../lvhowto/ChangingtheOrderofFPanelOb.html">set the tabbing order</a> of front panel objects by selecting <strong>Edit�Set Tabbing Order</strong>.</p>
<p class="Body">
				To prevent users from accessing a control by pressing the &lt;Tab&gt; key while a VI runs, place a checkmark in the <strong>Skip this control when tabbing</strong> checkbox in the <strong>Key Navigation</strong> page of the <a href="../lvhowto/ConfigControlsandIndicator.html">Properties</a> dialog box.

				You can change the color of many objects in LabVIEW. You can change the color of most front panel objects, panes on the front panel, and block diagram workspaces. You cannot change the color of <a href="../glang/ControlsPalette.html">system controls and indicators</a> because these objects appear in the colors you have set up for the system.</p>
<p class="Body">
				Use the Coloring tool to right-click an object or workspace to change the color of front panel objects, panes on the front panel, and block diagram workspaces. You also can change the default colors for some objects by selecting <strong>Tools�Options</strong> and selecting <a href="../lvdialog/Miscellaneous_Options.html">Environment</a> from the <strong>Category</strong> list.</p>
<p class="Body">
				Refer to the following guidelines when using color on a front panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color can distract the user from important information. For example, a yellow, green, or bright orange background makes it difficult to see a red danger light.</li>
<li>Some platforms provide limited colors. Black, white, and gray are often the best options for maintaining consistency on other platforms. </li>
<li>Avoid using color as the sole indicator of device state. Use line styles for plots to add another differentiating factor because users with some degree of color blindness may have problems detecting the change in state.</li>
<li>Use light gray, white, or pastel colors for backgrounds. Use the first row of colors in the color picker for front panel backgrounds and normal controls. Use the second row of colors in the color picker for highlighting important controls, such as an error notification.</li>
</ul><a name="Using_Imported_Graphics"></a><h2>Using Imported Graphics</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
			</p>
<p class="Body">You can import graphics from other applications to use as pane backgrounds, items in ring controls, and parts of other controls and indicators.</p>
<p class="Body">LabVIEW supports most standard graphic formats, including BMP, JPEG, animated GIF, MNG, animated MNG, and PNG. LabVIEW also supports transparency.</p>
<p class="Body">However, imported graphics might slow down screen updates. Make sure you do not place indicators and controls on top of a graphic object so that LabVIEW does not have to redraw the object each time the indicator updates.</p>

Click the <strong>Reorder</strong> button on the toolbar and select <strong>Group</strong> or <strong>Lock</strong> from the pull-down menu. Grouped objects maintain their relative arrangement and size when you use the Positioning tool to move and resize them. Locked objects maintain their position on the front panel. You cannot delete grouped or locked objects from the front panel or the block diagram until you ungroup or unlock them. You can set objects to be grouped and locked at the same time. If you set objects to be grouped and locked at the same time, you must ungroup and unlock them before you can delete them from the front panel or the block diagram.

				You can change the size of most front panel objects. When you move the Positioning tool over a resizable object, resizing handles appear at the points where you can resize the object. When you resize an object, the font size remains the same. Resizing a group of objects resizes all the objects within the group.</p>
<p class="Body">
				Some objects change size only horizontally or vertically when you resize them, such as digital numeric controls and indicators. Others keep the same proportions when you resize them, such as knobs. The Positioning cursor appears the same, but the dashed border that surrounds the object moves in only one direction. </p>
<p class="Body">You can manually restrict the growth direction when you resize an object. To restrict the growth vertically or horizontally or to maintain the current proportions of the object, press the &lt;Shift&gt; key while you click and drag the resizing handles. To resize an object around its center point, press the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key while you click and drag the resizing handles. To restrict the growth vertically or horizontally or to maintain the current proportions of the object and to resize an object around its center point, press the &lt;Ctrl-Shift&gt; keys while you click and drag the resizing handles.</p>

<p class="Body">To resize multiple objects to the same size, select the objects and select the <strong>Resize Objects</strong> pull-down menu on the toolbar. You can resize all the selected objects to the width or height of the largest or smallest object, and you can resize all the selected objects to a specific size in pixels. If you add splitter bars to the front panel and create panes, you can select different objects on multiple panes by pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key and selecting the objects you want to resize. 
			</p><a name="Scaling_Front_Panel_Objects"></a><h2>Scaling Front Panel Objects</h2>
<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				You can set front panel objects to scale, or automatically resize in relation to the pane size, when you resize the pane. You can set one object on the front panel to scale, or you can set all objects on an owning pane to scale. However, you cannot set multiple objects to scale on the front panel unless you set all of them to scale, you group the objects first, or the objects are on separate panes. You also can set a single object to fill a pane.</p>
<p class="Body">To set a single object to scale automatically when the pane resizes, right-click the object and select <strong>Scale Object with Pane</strong> from the shortcut menu. If you set a single front panel object to scale, the object resizes itself automatically in relation to any change in the pane size. The other objects on the front panel reposition themselves to remain consistent with their previous placement on the front panel but do not scale to fit the new size of the pane.</p>
<p class="Body">Immediately after you designate a single object on the front panel to scale automatically, gray lines outline several regions on the front panel, as shown in the following front panel. The regions define the positions of the other front panel objects in relation to the object you want to scale. When you resize the pane, the object you set to scale automatically resizes and repositions itself relative to its original location. The gray lines disappear when you run the VI.</p>
<p class="Anchor"><img src="noloc_fp_scalin.gif"></p>
<p class="Body">To set objects in an owning pane to scale automatically while the pane resizes, right-click a splitter bar and select <strong>Pane Sizing�Scale Objects While Resizing</strong> from the shortcut menu. An item that scales on the pane will scale while you are resizing the pane instead of when you are finished resizing the pane. To set all objects in an owning pane to scale automatically when the pane resizes, right-click a splitter bar and select <strong>Pane Sizing�Scale all Objects with Pane</strong> from the shortcut menu of the appropriate pane. If you set all objects on a pane to scale, all objects resize and reposition automatically in relation to any change in the pane size. If you set all objects on a pane to scale and a single object on the pane is already set to scale, a dialog box appears that prompts you to select between setting automatic scaling for the one object or for all objects on the pane. You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/Pane_Set_FP_Scaling.html">Set Scaling Mode</a> method to set all the pane's objects to scale programmatically.</p>
<p class="Body">When LabVIEW scales objects automatically, it follows the same conventions as when you resize an object manually. For example, some objects can resize only horizontally or vertically, and the font size remains the same when you resize an object.</p>
<p class="Body">After LabVIEW automatically scales an object, the object might not scale back to its exact original size when you size the pane back to its original position. Before you save the VI, select <strong>Edit�Undo</strong> to restore the original front panel window and object sizes.</p>
<p class="Body">You can set an array to scale or set the objects within an array to scale. If you set the array to scale, you adjust the number of rows and columns you can see within the array. If you set the objects within the array to scale, you always see the same number of rows and columns, though different sizes, within the array.</p>
<p class="Body">You also can set a cluster to scale or set objects within the cluster to scale. If you set a cluster to scale, the objects within the cluster do not scale. If you set objects within the cluster to scale, the cluster does not scale unless you right-click the cluster and select <strong>AutoSizing�Size to Fit</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p class="Body">To set a single object to fill the pane, right-click the object and select <strong>Fit Control to Pane</strong> from the shortcut menu. The object should be the only object in the pane, otherwise other objects are overlapped by the object you select to fit to the pane. The object resizes itself to fill the pane, and automatically resizes in relation to any change in the pane size.</p><a name="Adding_Space_to_the_Front_Panel_without_Resizing_the_Window"></a><h2>Adding or Reducing Space on the Front Panel without Resizing the Window</h2>
