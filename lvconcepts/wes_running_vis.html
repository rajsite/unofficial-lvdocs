<p class="Body">You can add VIs and dependent files under a Windows Embedded Standard target in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window. When you run a VI under a target, LabVIEW deploys the VI and the target settings to the Windows Embedded Standard target.</p>
<p class="Body">You can view the front panel of a VI running on the Windows Embedded Standard target if you connect the target to a monitor. The front panel on the target mirrors the front panel on the host computer. However, control and appearance of the front panel on the host and target have the following caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the host connects to the target, the target does not have control of the front panel. For example, you cannot resize, minimize, maximize, or move the front panel on the target. If you attempt to gain control of the user interface by other protocols, such as remote front panels, the attempt is denied. Ensure the location of the front panel does not truncate the front panel when you connect to the target.</li>
<li>When the host connects to the target, the front panel of the target displays <strong>Remotely Controlled</strong> in the window title and as a watermark in the bottom-right corner.</li>
<li>If the host disconnects from the target, the target gains control of the user interface on the target and the VI operates like a local VI. When the host reconnects to the target, the host regains control of the user interface and updates its control and indicator values with values made by the target. The host does not update its user interface with changes, such as front panel window size and position, made by the target.</li>
<li>When the host connects to the target and the VI stops running, the front panel on the target remains open. If the front panel on the host computer closes, the front panel on the target also closes. If the VI is running and you disconnect from the target on the host computer, the VI continues to run on the target.</li>
<li>With a few exceptions, all dialog boxes appear on only the host computer or only the target depending on which device has control of the user interface. For VI-based dialog boxes, the dialog boxes appear on both the host computer and target. When both the host computer and target display dialog boxes, only the host computer has control of the user interface.</li>
<li>For file dialog boxes and dialog boxes invoked by executing a call library node, such as a Windows or custom DLL, the dialog boxes always appear on the target. For these dialog boxes, the host computer displays a message to notify you of the dialog box activity on the target. The user interface on the host is locked until you interact with the dialog box on the target.</li>
</ul>
