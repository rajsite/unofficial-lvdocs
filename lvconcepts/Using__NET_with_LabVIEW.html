<p class="Body">
					
					The .NET Framework allows you to access Windows services such as the performance monitor, event log, and file system, as well as advanced Windows APIs such as the Speech Recognition and Generation service. The .NET Framework also provides access to Web protocols such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI.</p>
<p class="Body">You can use LabVIEW as a .NET client to access the objects, properties, methods, and events associated with .NET servers. You also can host .NET user interface controls on the front panel of a VI.  Although LabVIEW is not a .NET server, you can communicate to LabVIEW remotely with the <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_ActiveX_with_LabVIEW.html">ActiveX</a> server interface through .NET support for COM objects.</p>

You must use a <a href="../lvhowto/configuring_clr_version.html">.NET 2.0 configuration file</a> if you want to load .NET 2.0 mixed-mode assemblies. Refer to the <a href="../lvconcepts/net_defaults.html">requirements for using .NET with LabVIEW</a> for more information about .NET restrictions in LabVIEW.
