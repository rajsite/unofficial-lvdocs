<p class="Body">
			
				VI code complexity is a collective term that refers to several characteristics of a VI, including the number, type, and organization of front panel and block diagram nodes. LabVIEW presents code complexity in the following related but distinct ways:</p>

<li>Improved compilation speed</li>

<td class="Bordered">This value provides an overall representation of code complexity for a VI. The compiler uses this value to determine whether a VI requires too much memory during compilation to receive full optimizations. LabVIEW calculates this value based on internal compilation details related to the numbers provided by the <a href="../lvdialog/VI_Metrics_Dialog_Box.html">VI Metrics</a> window. However, these details are subject to change between versions of LabVIEW. Therefore, unlike the concrete statistics in the <strong>VI Metrics</strong> window, this code complexity value uses units that do not directly represent the implementation details of the compilation process. Instead, the units serve only as a point of reference by which to compare the code complexity of a VI to the environmental <a href="../lvdialog/Miscellaneous_Options.html#compiler">compiler optimizations threshold</a> that LabVIEW uses to limit optimizations.</td>
