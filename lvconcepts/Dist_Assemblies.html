<p class="Body">
				
After you create a .NET client application in LabVIEW, you can <a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html">build that project or VI</a> into a stand-alone application, shared library, packed project library, source distribution, ZIP file, or .NET interop assembly. You then can distribute the application to another computer as long as you also supply the relevant assembly and configuration files that define the characteristics and behaviors of the .NET objects in the application.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��National Instruments recommends that the target computer for the distributed application have the same or later version of the .NET Framework installed as the version that LabVIEW used to build the application. Refer to <a href="../lvconcepts/net_defaults.html#library">Compatible Class Libraries</a> for more information about the .NET Framework requirements of the target computer.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Related Files to Distribute</h3>
<p class="Body">You must distribute the following files along with any application that you build from a .NET client application:</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��You can <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">build an installer</a> for your distributed application that includes the relevant files.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
<li><span class="Monospace">data</span> directory of the application�When you create an application, LabVIEW automatically copies any necessary .NET assemblies that were not located in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) into this directory.</li>
<li>Private .NET assemblies that are located in the GAC�LabVIEW does not copy these assemblies into the <span class="Monospace">data</span> directory, so you must distribute them yourself.</li>
<li><a href="../lvconcepts/Config_NET_App.html">.NET configuration file</a>�If a project or VI relies on a .NET configuration file, any application that you build from that project or VI requires a similar configuration file. 
	<br><br>You do not need to distribute a configuration file in the following situations:
	<ul>
<li>The original project or VI does not require a configuration file.</li>
<li>You are building a .NET interop assembly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where to Save Distributed Files on a Target Computer</h3>
<p class="Body">For a distributed .NET application to run on a target computer, the relevant files must be saved in the following locations on the target computer:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="Monospace">data</span> directory�Store this directory in the same directory as the application.</li>
<li>Private .NET assemblies from the GAC�Store the assemblies in the GAC or in another location that the CLR searches.</li>
<li>.NET configuration file�The location for the configuration file depends on what type of application you are distributing.
		<ul>
<li>Stand-alone application�Store the configuration file in the same directory as the application.</li>
<li>Shared library, packed project library, source distribution, or ZIP file�Store the configuration file in the directory of the application that is using the shared library, packed project library, source distribution, or ZIP file.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
