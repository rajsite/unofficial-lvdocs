</noscript><h1>Types of Distributions</h1>
<p class="Body">A distribution is a collection of software content wrapped up for consumption by clients of the software.</p>
<p class="Body">You can distribute your applications to clients into one of the following output types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package</strong>�Contents of the distribution build into an NI Package Manager package file (<span class="Monospace">.nipkg</span>). Your clients can install the distribution directly from Package Manager. You can also add the distribution to a feed so that clients can subscribe to the feed and install the distribution from Package Manager via network access.</li>
<li><strong>Package installer</strong>�Contents of the distribution build into an installer file (<span class="Monospace">.exe</span>). By default, the package installer includes all the package dependencies in the output so that your clients can install the distribution without network access.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">A�feed�is a collection of package files that includes a manifest containing information on the included packages. NI recommends using feeds when distributing multiple packages that have dependencies on one another. With feeds, you can create a single location where you host and maintain all packages intended for end user access.</p>
