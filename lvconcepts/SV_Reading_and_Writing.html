</noscript><h1>Choosing a Method of Reading and Writing Shared Variables</h1>
<p class="Body">When choosing a method of reading and writing <a href="SV_Publishing_Latest_Values.html">shared variables</a>, you must consider several factors, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update speed</li>
<li>Programming complexity</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">The following table describes the use cases, advantages, and disadvantages of the methods you can use to read and write shared variables over a network.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��After you program your applications to read and write shared variables with one or more of the following features, you must <a href="../lvconcepts/SV_Deploying.html">deploy the shared variables</a> to make them available on the network.</td>

<td class="Bordered">Reading and writing large numbers of shared variables. For example, if you need to read 50 shared variables of the double data type in a specific <a href="../lvconcepts/Project_Libraries.html">project library</a>, reading those shared variables programmatically is the most efficient method.</td>
<td class="Bordered">
<ul>
<li>A single Shared Variable function can access multiple shared variables. Other methods can read and write only one shared variable at a time.</li>
<li>Scalable. If you add 50 shared variables to a project, you do not have to update your block diagram to read and write each of those variables.</li>
<li>Offers access to <a href="../lvioscanhelp/io_vars.html">I/O variables</a>.</li>
