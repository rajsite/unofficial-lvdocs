<p class="Body">
				
				
				Use disk streaming to save memory resources by reducing the number of times a function interacts with the operating system to open and close a file. Disk streaming refers to keeping files open while you perform multiple read or write operations within a loop.</p>
<p class="Body">Avoid wiring a path control or a constant to a function or VI that reads from or writes to a file, such as the Write to Text File function or the Read from Binary File function, as doing so adds the overhead of opening and closing the file each time the function or VI executes. Instead, implement disk streaming operations to eliminate this overhead.</p>
<h2>When to Use Disk Streaming</h2>
<p class="Body">Consider the following information when determining whether a disk streaming operation is appropriate for your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk streaming is ideal in lengthy data acquisition operations where speed is critical.</li>
<li>Use disk streaming to write data continuously to a file while acquisition is still in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementing a Disk Streaming Operation</h2>
<p class="Body">To create a typical disk streaming operation, place the <a href="../glang/Open_Create_Replace_File.html">Open/Create/Replace File</a> function and the <a href="../glang/Close_File.html">Close File</a> function outside the loop as in the following block diagram.</p>
<p class="Anchor"><img src="loc_bd_DiskStreaming.gif"></p>
<p class="Body">In a disk streaming design pattern, a VI continuously writes to a file within the loop without the overhead associated with opening and closing the file in each iteration.</p>
