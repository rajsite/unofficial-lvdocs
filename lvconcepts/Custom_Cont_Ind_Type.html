<p class="Body">
				
				
				
				Use custom controls and indicators to extend the available set of front panel objects. You can create custom user interface components for an application that vary cosmetically from built-in LabVIEW controls and indicators. You can save a custom control or indicator you created in a directory or LLB and use the custom control or indicator on other front panels. You also can create an icon for the custom control or indicator and add it to the <a href="../glang/ControlsPalette.html">Controls</a> palette. Refer to the <a href="../lvhowto/Cust_Cont_Caveats.html">caveats and recommendations</a> before you begin creating custom controls and indicators.
				
			</p>
<p class="Body">
				Use type definitions and strict type definitions to link all the instances of a custom control or indicator to a saved custom control or indicator file. You can make changes to all instances of the custom control or indicator by editing only the saved custom control or indicator file, which is useful if you use the same custom control or indicator in several VIs.
			</p>
<table class="Borderless">

<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��You also can use <a href="Using_LabVIEW_XControls.html">XControls</a> to design and create complex controls and indicators in LabVIEW. Unlike custom controls, XControls have dynamic run-time and edit-time behavior that is defined by VIs that run in the background. You can create and edit XControls only in the LabVIEW Professional Development System. If a VI contains an XControl, you can run the VI in all LabVIEW packages.

<p class="Body">
					
					Use the Control Editor window to customize controls and indicators and to <a href="../lvhowto/Defin_Priv_Data_Class.html">define the private data control</a> for a LabVIEW class. For example, you can change the size, color, and relative position of the elements of a control or indicator and import images into the control or indicator.</p>
<p class="Body">You can display the Control Editor window in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click a control or indicator on the front panel and select <strong>Advanced�Customize</strong> from the shortcut menu.</li>
<li>Use the Positioning tool to select a control or indicator on the front panel and select <strong>Edit�Customize

<td><strong>Note</strong>��If you are defining the class private data control, the Control Editor window opens with the <strong>Cluster of class private data</strong> on the block diagram automatically. Also, LabVIEW defaults the ring control of the Control Editor window to <strong>Class Private Data</strong> and you cannot change it.</td>
</tr>
</table>
					</li>
<li>Right-click the instance of a type definition or strict type definition from the front panel or block diagram and select <strong>Open Type Def.</strong> from the shortcut menu.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Even though the Control Editor window looks like a front panel, you use it only for customizing a single control or indicator. For a LabVIEW class this single control must be a cluster. The Control Editor window does not have a block diagram and cannot run.</p>
<p class="Body">The Control Editor window can contain only one control or indicator. You can customize an array or cluster control or indicator that contains other sub-controls or sub-indicators. The array or cluster itself is the single control. The <strong>Invalid Control</strong> button <img style="display:inline" src="noloc_env_newnotokborder.gif"> appears on the Control Editor window toolbar while you move controls or indicators in and out of an array or cluster. Click the <strong>Invalid Control</strong> button to display an explanation of the error in the <a href="../lvdialog/Error_List_Dialog_Box.html">Error list</a> window.</p>
<p class="Body">A mode indicator button on the Control Editor window toolbar shows whether you are in edit mode <img style="display:inline" src="noloc_env_edit.gif"> or in customize mode <img style="display:inline" src="noloc_env_customize_new.gif">. Click this button to toggle between the two modes. You also can switch between modes by selecting <strong>Operate�Change to Customize Mode</strong> or <strong>Operate�Change to Edit Mode</strong>. The Control Editor window opens in edit mode.</p>
<p class="Body">Use edit mode to change the size or color of a control or indicator and to select options from its shortcut menu, just as you do in edit mode on a front panel.</p>
<p class="Body">Use customize mode to make extensive changes to controls or indicators by changing the individual parts of a control or indicator.</p><a name="Customize_Mode_Shortcut_Menus"></a><h3>Customize Mode Shortcut Menus</h3>
<p class="Body">
				
  In customize mode, a shortcut menu for each part replaces the shortcut menu for the control or indicator as a whole. Different parts have different shortcut menus. Use the shortcut menus to perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize <a href="Custom_Cont_Ind_Type.html#Adding_Cosmetic_Parts_to_Custom_Controls_and_Indicators">cosmetic parts</a>, such as objects from the <strong>Decorations</strong> palette added to a custom control or indicator.</li>
<li>Customize text parts, such as the name label.</li>
<li>Customize <a href="Custom_Cont_Ind_Type.html#Customizing_Individual_Parts_of_Controls_and_Indicators">controls or indicators as parts</a>, such as the numeric control used for the digital display of a slide control. Knobs, meters, and charts also use a numeric control for a digital display. Some controls are more complicated. For example, the graph uses a tree control for its cursor display part.</li>
</ul><a name="Customizing_Individual_Parts_of_Controls_and_Indicators"></a><h2>Customizing Individual Parts of Controls and Indicators</h2><a name="Independent_Parts_of_Controls_or_Indicators"></a><h3>Independent Parts of Controls or Indicators</h3>
<p class="Body">All controls and indicators are built from smaller parts. For example, the following illustration shows the individual parts of a slide control.</p>
<p class="Anchor"><img src="loc_eps_fig1_an159.gif"></p>
<p class="Body">
				
				
 When you switch to customize mode in the Control Editor window, the parts of the control or indicator become independent. You can make changes to each part without affecting any other part. Customize mode shows all parts of the control or indicator, including any parts that are hidden in edit mode, such as the name label or the radix on a numeric control. Because the parts of the control or indicator are detached from each other, you cannot operate or change the value of the control or indicator while in customize mode.</p>
<p class="Body">In customize mode, you can use the Positioning tool to select two or more parts of the control or indicator and rearrange the parts by using the <a href="../lvhowto/Alignment_Grid.html">Align Objects</a>, <a href="../lvhowto/Distributing_Objects.html">Distribute Objects</a>, and <a href="../lvhowto/Reordering_Objects.html">Reorder</a> pull-down menus on the toolbar.</p><a name="Control_Parts_Window"></a><h3>Control Parts Window</h3>
<p class="Body">
				
  Select <strong>Window�Show Parts Window</strong> to display the <a href="../lvdialog/Control_Parts_DB.html">Control Parts</a> window. Use the <strong>Control Parts</strong> window to size and position the individual parts of a control or indicator. The <strong>Control Parts</strong> window identifies the parts of the control or indicator and shows the exact position and size of each part in pixels.</p>
<p class="Body">The <strong>Current Part</strong> section of the <strong>Control Parts</strong> window contains an image and the name of the part you selected in the Control Editor window. Click the <strong>Current Part</strong> display to display and select among all the parts of the control or indicator. Click the <strong>Current Part</strong> increment or decrement arrow to scroll through the parts of the control or indicator.</p>
<p class="Body">When you move or resize a part in the Control Editor window, LabVIEW updates the position and size in the <strong>Current Part</strong> and <strong>Part Position and Dimensions</strong> sections of the <strong>Control Parts</strong> window. You also can enter the position and size values directly in the <strong>Part Position and Dimensions</strong> section to move or resize the part in the Control Editor window, which is useful when you must make two parts exactly the same size or align one part with another. After entering position and size values in the <strong>Part Position and Dimensions</strong> section, press the &lt;Enter&gt; key or click the left mouse button for the changes to take effect.</p><a name="Adding_Cosmetic_Parts_to_Custom_Controls_and_Indicators"></a><h2>Adding Cosmetic Parts to Custom Controls and Indicators</h2>
<p class="Body">
				You can use the Control Editor window to add graphics, text, and decorations to a custom control or indicator in either edit mode or customize mode. If you paste a graphic or text from the clipboard, create a label using the Labeling tool, or select a decoration from the <a href="../glang/Diagram_Decorations.html">Decorations</a> palette, the object becomes a new decoration part of the control or indicator and appears with the control or indicator when you place it on a front panel. In the Control Editor window, you can move, resize, change the layering order, or replace the new decoration part. When you use a custom control or indicator on a front panel, you can change the size of any decoration parts you added. However, you cannot move the added decoration parts.</p><a name="Customize_Mode_Shortcut_Menu_Items_for_Cosmetic_Parts"></a><h3>Customize Mode Shortcut Menu Items for Cosmetic Parts</h3>
<p class="Body">Cosmetic parts can have a single graphic, multiple graphics that display at different times, and multiple graphics that are independent from each other. To customize cosmetic parts, place the Control Editor window in customize mode and right-click the cosmetic part you want to customize. The shortcut menu items available depend on the type of cosmetic part.</p><a name="Cosmetic_Parts_with_a_Single_Graphic"></a><h4>Cosmetic Parts with a Single Graphic</h4>
<p class="Body">The shortcut menu for cosmetic parts with a single graphic contains the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
					<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>�Places a copy of the graphic of the part on the clipboard. After you copy a shape to the clipboard, right-click a part and select <strong>Import Picture from Clipboard</strong> from the shortcut menu to import the shape into the part. <br><br>When you need simple shapes for customizing cosmetic parts, consider copying the shapes from built-in parts of other controls or indicators instead of creating them in a graphics application. For example, if you need a simple rectangular shape, right-click the housing and select <strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong> from the shortcut menu. Graphics taken from built-in parts or decorations resize better than graphics made in a graphics application. For example, when you resize a rectangle drawn in a graphics application, the rectangle grows uniformly, enlarging its area and making its border thicker. When you resize a rectangle copied from a part of a built-in control or indicator, the rectangle keeps the same thin border.�
 <br><br>Parts copied from a built-in control or indicator have a similar appearance on color monitors and on black-and-white monitors. In addition, you can use the Coloring tool to add color to graphics you copy from built-in parts and decorations. You cannot change the color of a graphic you import from another source because the color is part of the definition of the graphic.
				</li>
<li>
					<strong>Import Picture from Clipboard</strong>�Replaces the current graphic of a cosmetic part with the graphic currently on the clipboard. For example, you can import graphics of an open and closed valve for a Boolean switch. If the clipboard does not contain a graphic, the <strong>Import Picture from Clipboard</strong> item is not available.</li>
<li>
					<strong>Import from Clipboard at Same Size</strong>�Replaces the current graphic with the graphic currently on the clipboard and keeps the original size of the part, shrinking or enlarging the clipboard graphic to fit. If the clipboard does not contain a graphic, the <strong>Import from Clipboard at Same Size</strong> item is not available.</li>
<li>
					<strong>Import from File</strong>�Replaces the current graphic of a cosmetic part with the graphic you select in the file dialog box.</li>
<li>
					<strong>Import from File at Same Size</strong>�Replaces the current graphic with the graphic you select in the file dialog box and keeps the original size of the part, shrinking or enlarging the graphic from file to fit.</li>
<li>
					<strong>Revert</strong>�Restores a part to its original appearance without changing the position of the part. If you display the Control Editor window for a front panel control or indicator and make changes to a part, selecting <strong>Revert</strong> from the shortcut menu changes the part back to the way it looks on the front panel. If you open a custom control or indicator file in the Control Editor window, the <strong>Revert</strong> item is not available.</li>
<li>
					<strong>Original Size</strong>�Restores the graphic of a part to its original size, which is useful for graphics you import from other applications and then resize. Some graphics imported from other applications do not look as good as the original when you resize them. You might want to restore the imported graphic to its original size to improve the appearance of the graphic. If you do not import a graphic, the <strong>Original Size</strong> item is not available.</li>
</ul>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��You also can replace a decoration with an image from the clipboard by selecting the decoration and selecting <strong>Edit�Paste</strong>. To replace a decoration with an image from a file, right-click the decoration and select <strong>Import from File</strong> from the shortcut menu.</td>
</tr>
</table><a name="Cosmetic_Parts_with_Multiple_Dependent_Graphics"></a><h4>Cosmetic Parts with Multiple Dependent Graphics</h4>
<p class="Body">Some cosmetic parts have multiple dependent graphics that display at different times. The different graphics are the same size and use the same colors. When you move or resize the current graphic of the cosmetic part, its other graphics also move the same amount or change size proportionally. For example, a Boolean switch has four different graphics. The first graphic shows the FALSE state. The second graphic shows the TRUE state. The third graphic shows the <a href="../lvhowto/ChangeMechActOfBoolSwitch.html">Switch When Released state</a>, which is the TRUE to FALSE transition state. The fourth graphic shows the Latch When Released state, which is the FALSE to TRUE transition state. When the Boolean control is in the Switch When Released state or the Latch When Released state, the value of the Boolean control does not change until you release the mouse button. Between the time you click the mouse button and the time you release the mouse button, the Boolean control shows the third or fourth graphic as a transition state.</p>
<p class="Body">The shortcut menu for cosmetic parts with multiple dependent graphics contains all the items available for cosmetic parts with a single graphic plus the <strong>Picture Item</strong> item. Selecting <strong>Picture Item</strong> from the shortcut menu displays all the graphics that belong to a cosmetic part. The current graphic item has a dark border around it. When you import a graphic, you change only the current graphic item. To import a graphic for one of the other graphic items, right-click the part, select <strong>Picture Item</strong> from the shortcut menu, select the graphic item, and import the new graphic.</p><a name="Cosmetic_Parts_with_Multiple_Independent_Graphics"></a><h4>Cosmetic Parts with Multiple Independent Graphics</h4>
<p class="Body">A cosmetic part with more than one graphic can have graphics of different sizes that each use different colors. For example, the slide uses two graphics of different sizes to show which slider is active on a multivalue slide. The shortcut menu for cosmetic parts with multiple independent graphics contains all the items available for cosmetic parts with single graphics and multiple dependent graphics plus the <strong>Independent Sizes</strong> item. Select <strong>Independent Sizes</strong> from the shortcut menu to place a checkmark next to it so you can move and resize each graphic individually without changing the other graphics of the cosmetic part.</p><a name="Text_Parts"></a><h4>Text Parts</h4>
<p class="Body">A text part is a graphic with text, such as a label. The shortcut menu for a text part contains all the items available for cosmetic parts with a single graphic and the items available for text elements on a front panel in edit mode. The <strong>Control Parts</strong> window shows only the background graphic for the text part, not the text itself. You can customize the background graphic but not the text.</p><a name="Edit_Mode_Option_for_Boolean_Controls_and_Indicators"></a><h3>Edit Mode Option for Boolean Controls and Indicators</h3>
<p class="Body">You can import graphics into Boolean controls and indicators when the Control Editor window is in edit mode, unlike other controls and indicators, into which you can import graphics only when the Control Editor window is in customize mode. When the Control Editor window is in edit mode and you right-click a Boolean control or indicator, the shortcut menu that appears contains all the items available for Boolean controls and indicators on a front panel in edit mode, as well as the <strong>Import Picture from Clipboard</strong> item.</p><a name="Linking_Custom_Controls_and_Indicators_to_a_Saved_Custom_Control_or_Indicator_File"></a><h2>Linking Custom Controls and Indicators to a Saved Custom Control or Indicator File</h2>
<p class="Body">
					When you place a custom control or indicator in a VI, no connection exists between the custom control or indicator you saved and the instance of the custom control or indicator in the VI. Each instance of a custom control or indicator is a separate, independent copy. Therefore, changes you make to a custom control or indicator file do not affect VIs already using that custom control or indicator. If you want to link instances of a custom control or indicator to the custom control or indicator file, save the custom control or indicator as a <a href="Custom_Cont_Ind_Type.html#Type_Definitions_and_Strict_Type_Definitions">type definition or strict type definition</a>. All instances of a type definition or a strict type definition link to the original file from which you created them.</p>
<p class="Body">When you save a custom control or indicator as a type definition or strict type definition, any data type changes you make to the type definition or strict type definition affect all instances of the type definition or strict type definition in all the VIs that use it. Also, cosmetic changes you make to a strict type definition affect all instances of the strict type definition on the front panel.</p><a name="Type_Definitions_and_Strict_Type_Definitions"></a><h2>Type Definitions and Strict Type Definitions</h2>
<p class="Body">Use type definitions and strict type definitions to link all the instances of a custom control or indicator to a saved custom control or indicator file. You can make changes to all instances of the custom control or indicator by editing only the saved custom control or indicator file, which is valuable if you use the same custom control or indicator in several VIs.</p><a name="Type_Definitions"></a><h3>Type Definitions</h3>
<p class="Body">
					
					
					
					
					Type definitions identify the correct data type for each instance of a custom control or indicator. When the data type of a type definition changes, all instances of the type definition automatically update. In other words, the data type of the instances of the type definition change in each VI where the type definition is used. However, because type definitions identify only the data type, only the values that are part of the data type update. For example, on numeric controls, the data range is not part of the data type. Therefore, type definitions for numeric controls do not define the data range for the instances of the type definitions. Also, because the item names in ring controls do not define the data type, changes to ring control item names in a type definition do not change the item names in instances of the type definition. However, if you change the item names in the type definition for an enumerated type control, the instances update because the item names are part of the data type. An instance of a type definition can have its own unique caption, label, description, tip strip, default value, size, color, or style of control or indicator, such as a knob instead of a slide.</p>
<p class="Body">If you change the data type in a type definition, LabVIEW converts the old default value in instances of the type definition to the new data type, if possible. LabVIEW cannot preserve the instance default value if the data type changes to an incompatible type, such as replacing a numeric control or indicator with a string control or indicator. When the data type of a type definition changes to a data type incompatible with the previous type definition, LabVIEW sets the default value of instances to the default value you specify in the <span class="Monospace">.ctl</span> file. If you do not specify a default value, LabVIEW uses the default value for the data type. For example, if you change a type definition from a numeric to a string type, LabVIEW replaces any default values associated with the old numeric data type with empty strings.</p><a name="Strict_Type_Definitions"></a><h3>Strict Type Definitions</h3>
<p class="Body">
					
					
    A strict type definition forces everything about an instance to be identical to the strict type definition, except the caption, label, description, tip strip, and default value. As with type definitions, the data type of a strict type definition remains the same everywhere you use the strict type definition. Strict type definitions also define other values, such as range checking on numeric controls and the item names in ring controls. The only VI Server properties available for strict type definitions are those that affect the appearance of the control or indicator, such as Visible, Disabled, Key Focus, Blinking, Position, and Bounds.</p>
<table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>�� If you link a constant to a <em>strict</em> type definition, the constant will instead behave as though the link is not strict.  Strict type definitions require that all instances of a type definition maintain identical cosmetic attributes. However, most cosmetic attributes are invalid on the block diagram. Because constants are only found on the block diagram, they do not maintain cosmetic attributes.</td>

<p class="Body">If you delete an element from the cluster type definition or cluster strict type definition wired to the Bundle by Name function or the Unbundle By Name function, you must change the block diagram because the reference to the missing element becomes invalid.

Click the Bundle by Name function or the Unbundle By Name function to display a list of valid names from which to select.</p>
<p class="Body">When you create references to controls in a cluster type definition or cluster strict type definition, LabVIEW uses the cluster order to determine which controls the references point to in the cluster. Because of this behavior, if you delete a control from the cluster type definition or cluster strict type definition, the remaining reference that points to the deleted control may now point to a different control in the cluster. If you delete a control in a cluster type definition or cluster strict type definition, make sure that each reference still points to the correct control in the cluster.</p>
