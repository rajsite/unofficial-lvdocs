</noscript><h1>Making Shared Variables Available on a Network</h1>
<p class="Body">You must deploy <a href="SV_Publishing_Latest_Values.html">shared variables</a> to the <a href="../lvconcepts/NI_PSP.html">Shared Variable Engine (SVE)</a> before you can read and write those shared variables over a network. Deploying a shared variable creates a memory space for the shared variable in the SVE. Undeploying a shared variable frees the memory resources allocated to that shared variable.</p>
<p class="Body">When you run a VI that reads or writes a shared variable with a <a href="../lvcomm/variable_node.html">Shared Variable</a> node, LabVIEW automatically deploys the <a href="../lvconcepts/Project_Libraries.html">project library</a> that contains that shared variable. However, LabVIEW does not automatically undeploy the project library when the application terminates. Therefore, you do not need to deploy shared variables before <a href="../lvconcepts/SV_Using_Nodes.html">reading and writing them with Shared Variable nodes</a>, but you do need to undeploy those shared variables to free the memory resources allocated to those shared variables. Additionally, you must deploy shared variables explicitly if you are <a href="SV_Reading_and_Writing.html">reading and writing shared variables with other methods</a>. The following list describes the methods you can use to deploy and undeploy shared variables.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Interactive">Edit-time method</a>�Deploy and undeploy shared variables at edit-time when you are developing an application that accesses a small number of shared variables.</li>
<li><a href="#Programmatic">Run-time method</a>�Deploy and undeploy shared variables at run-time when you plan to distribute an application as a stand-alone application. Deploying and undeploying shared variables at run-time also is useful if your application accesses a large number shared variables.

<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td><strong>Note</strong>��If you plan to distribute a stand-alone application that uses shared variables, do not include the <span class="Monospace">.lvlib</span> file in an LLB or in the executable.

<p class="Body">To deploy a shared variable, right-click the project library in the <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_LabVIEW_Projects.html">Project Explorer</a> window that contains the shared variable and select <strong>Deploy</strong>. This action deploys all of the shared variables in the project library to the SVE. Perform this action before running applications that read and write shared variables with methods other than using Shared Variable nodes.</p>
<p class="Body">To undeploy a shared variable, right-click the project library that contains the shared variable and select <strong>Undeploy</strong>.</p><a name="Programmatic"></a><h2>Deploying and Undeploying Shared Variables at Run-Time</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="Platform">(Windows)</span> To deploy shared variables at run-time, place a checkmark in the <strong>Deploy shared variable libraries at application execution</strong> checkbox on the <a href="../lvdialog/Deploy_Shared_Variable_Page.html">Shared Variable Deployment</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Build_App_or_DLL_DB.html">Application Properties</a> dialog box.</p>
<p class="Body">You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/Application_m.html">Deploy Library</a> and <a href="../lvprop/App_LibUndeploy_Library.html">Undeploy Library</a> methods on any platform to deploy and undeploy libraries that contain shared variables. For example, in the following figure, the Deploy Library method deploys <span class="Monospace">My Library.lvlib</span> before the <a href="../lvcomm/Search_Var_Objects.html">Search Variable Container</a> function searches for the shared variables in that project library. The <a href="../lvcomm/SV_Dynamic_Open.html">Open Variable Connection</a> function then opens connections to those shared variables.</p>
<p class="Anchor"><img src="loc_bd_Deploying_Programmatically.gif"></p>
<p class="Body">In the following figure, the Undeploy Library method undeploys <span class="Monospace">My Library.lvlib</span> after the <a href="../lvcomm/SV_Dynamic_Close.html">Close Variable Connection</a> function closes connections to the shared variables in that project library.</p>
