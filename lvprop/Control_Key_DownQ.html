<p class="Body">Generated on a control that has keyboard focus. If a key press matches a keyboard shortcut in the VI menu, such as Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V, LabVIEW does not generate a Key Down event, regardless of whether the menu item is enabled.</p> <h3>Key Down Event Caveats</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="Platform">(Windows)</span> F3 generates a Key Down event only in the LabVIEW Run-Time Engine.</li>
<li>LabVIEW only generates events for the <strong>Cluster&#0187;All Elements</strong> source when the cluster has keyboard focus, not when an individual element inside the cluster has keyboard focus.</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Event Data Fields</h2>

<table class="Bordered">
<tr><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Name</th><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Source</strong></td><td class="Bordered"><a href="../lvprop/event_source.html">Source</a> of the event. LabVIEW UI refers to any built-in user interface event.

<table class="Bordered">
<tr><td class = "Bordered">0</td><td class = "Bordered">LabVIEW UI</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Type</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Type of event that occurred, such as Mouse Down, Value Change, Timeout, and so on.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Time</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value of the millisecond timer when the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Time</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value of the millisecond timer when the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Char</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Integer value that corresponds to the key pressed on the keyboard and represents a character from the current code page that your system uses. You also can modify the data returned by this event data field.
Search for <span class="Monospace">code pages</span> on the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_Microsoft)">Microsoft Web site</a> for a listing of the code page tables supported by Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>VKey</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Enumerated type indicating the virtual key code of the key pressed. Values include ASCII, Shift, NumLock, F1, and so on. You also can modify the data received from this event data field.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>VKey</strong> has separate values for the &lt;Enter&gt; key on the alphanumeric keyboard and &lt;Enter&gt; key on the numeric keypad.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>ScanCode</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Scan code unique for each key on the keyboard. The values are unique for each physical key, and allow you to match Key Up and Key Down events.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Mods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-independent modifiers. LabVIEW returns all platform-dependent modifiers in the <strong>PlatMods</strong> event data field. For key events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event occurred on the numeric keypad. For mouse events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event was a double-click. For both events, a Boolean is returned if the platform-independent menu key, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt; on Windows or &lt;Command&gt; on macOS, was pressed when the event occurred. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>PlatMods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-dependent modifiers. Specifies if platform-dependent keys, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;Command&gt;, and &lt;Option&gt; were held down when the event was triggered. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field. A key can be both a <strong>Mod</strong> and <strong>PlatMod</strong>. For example, &lt;Ctrl&gt; is the platform-independent menu key on Windows, but you also can use it in platform-dependent programming.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>FocusObj</strong></td><td class="Bordered">A reference to the object that has keyboard focus. When the event is for a control, it might be a sub-component, like a scale, label, and so on, rather than the control itself. You also can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Discard?</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Allows you to prevent LabVIEW from processing the event, bypassing the behavior normally triggered by that event. The default is FALSE.
</td></tr>
