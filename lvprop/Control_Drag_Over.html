<p class="Body">Generated when there is a drag and drop operation pending, as the mouse moves over a control.</p> <p class="Body">You can use this event in conjunction with other control events to <a href="../lvhowto/drag_and_drop_programmatic.html">implement custom drag-and-drop behavior</a>. Use this event if the drop target allows or disallows dropping on it depending on where the mouse is located. For example, you can use this event if you only want to allow a user to drop in a graph plot area and nowhere else on the graph. </p>
<p class="Body">You may want to use the <a href="../lvprop/Control_Drag_Enter.html">Drag Enter</a> event instead if the mouse location on the target is inconsequential. Because the Drag Over event fires continuously as it checks to see if the drag is accepted, as opposed to the Drag Enter event which fires once, you also may want to use the Drag Enter event if you do not need to specify a location on the target.</p>  
<h2>Event Data Fields</h2>

<table class="Bordered">
<tr><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Name</th><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Source</strong></td><td class="Bordered"><a href="../lvprop/event_source.html">Source</a> of the event. LabVIEW UI refers to any built-in user interface event.

<br><br>
<table class="Bordered">
<tr><td class = "Bordered">0</td><td class = "Bordered">LabVIEW UI</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Type</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Type of event that occurred, such as Mouse Down, Value Change, Timeout, and so on.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Time</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value of the millisecond timer when the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Time</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value of the millisecond timer when the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Coords</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Coordinates of the location of the mouse click at the time the event occurs. Coordinates are relative to the drop target's owning pane origin, excluding clusters.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Button</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value that corresponds to which mouse button the user clicked. Left mouse button is 1, right mouse button is 2. Operating systems might assign higher numbers if you have a mouse with more than two buttons. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Mods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-independent modifiers. LabVIEW returns all platform-dependent modifiers in the <strong>PlatMods</strong> event data field. For key events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event occurred on the numeric keypad. For mouse events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event was a double-click. For both events, a Boolean is returned if the platform-independent menu key, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt; on Windows or &lt;Command&gt; on macOS, was pressed when the event occurred. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>PlatMods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-dependent modifiers. Specifies if platform-dependent keys, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;Command&gt;, and &lt;Option&gt; were held down when the event was triggered. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field. A key can be both a <strong>Mod</strong> and <strong>PlatMod</strong>. For example, &lt;Ctrl&gt; is the platform-independent menu key on Windows, but you also can use it in platform-dependent programming.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Available Data Names</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Array of unique names of data types available during this drag and drop operation. Use this array to determine if a data type is available that the drop target can accept
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Accepted?</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Reports to the drag source the action that the drop target would take if the drop occurred at this moment. TRUE, if the target would accept the drop, FALSE otherwise.
</td></tr>
