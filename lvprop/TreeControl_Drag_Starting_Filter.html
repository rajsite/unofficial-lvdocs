<p class="Body">Generated when you start a drag from a tree control.</p> <p class="Body">Use this event to signal when a drag and drop operation begins from a specific control. This event is generated only when LabVIEW begins a drag and drop operation on a tree control. You can use the <a href="../lvprop/Control_StartDrag.html">Start Drag</a> method to begin a drag from other controls.</p> <p class="Body"><a href="#examples">Example</a></p>
<h2>Event Data Fields</h2>

<table class="Bordered">
<tr><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Name</th><th class="Bordered Left-Align">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Source</strong></td><td class="Bordered"><a href="../lvprop/event_source.html">Source</a> of the event. LabVIEW UI refers to any built-in user interface event.

<br><br>
<table class="Bordered">
<tr><td class = "Bordered">0</td><td class = "Bordered">LabVIEW UI</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Type</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Type of event that occurred, such as Mouse Down, Value Change, Timeout, and so on.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Time</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value of the millisecond timer when the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>CtlRef</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Reference to the control on which the event occurred.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Coords</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Coordinates of the location of the mouse click at the time the event occurs. Coordinates are relative to the drop target's owning pane origin, excluding clusters.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Button</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Value that corresponds to which mouse button the user clicked. Left mouse button is 1, right mouse button is 2. Operating systems might assign higher numbers if you have a mouse with more than two buttons. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Mods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-independent modifiers. LabVIEW returns all platform-dependent modifiers in the <strong>PlatMods</strong> event data field. For key events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event occurred on the numeric keypad. For mouse events, this event returns a Boolean indicating if the event was a double-click. For both events, a Boolean is returned if the platform-independent menu key, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt; on Windows or &lt;Command&gt; on macOS, was pressed when the event occurred. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>PlatMods</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Cluster of Booleans that contain platform-dependent modifiers. Specifies if platform-dependent keys, such as &lt;Ctrl&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;Command&gt;, and &lt;Option&gt; were held down when the event was triggered. For filter events, you can modify the data returned by this event data field. A key can be both a <strong>Mod</strong> and <strong>PlatMod</strong>. For example, &lt;Ctrl&gt; is the platform-independent menu key on Windows, but you also can use it in platform-dependent programming.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Drag Data</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Indicates the data provided during the drag and drop operation. For filter events, you can modify this field to provide your own custom data for the drag and drop operation.
You cannot use the prefix <span class="Monospace">LV_</span> on a user-defined data name, because it is reserved for LabVIEW data types. You can use the built-in LabVIEW data types and names.

<td class="Bordered">Path</td>

</table></td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Drag Mode</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Specifies the operations that this control supports during the drag, such as copy or move, copy only, move only. If you select copy or move, pressing the &#60;Ctrl&#62; key copies the item. The operations you support control the values that the <strong>Results</strong> output of the <a href="Control_Drag_Ended.html">Drag Ended</a> and <a href="Control_Drag_Source_Update.html">Drag Source Update</a> events can provide. <br><br>For filter events, you can modify this field to change the drag mode when this event is generated.
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="Bordered"><strong>Discard?</strong></td><td class="Bordered">Allows you to prevent LabVIEW from processing the event, bypassing the behavior normally triggered by that event. The default is FALSE.
