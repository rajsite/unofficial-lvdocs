<td class="Bordered">Specifies the parity used with every frame that is transmitted or received. Valid values include: (0) Parity None, (1) Parity Odd, (2) Parity Even, (3) Parity Mark, (4) Parity Space. Mark means that the parity bit exists and is always 1. Space means that the parity bit exists and is always 0. <a href="Serial_Instr_3FFF0023.html">Details</a></td>

<tr>
<td class="Bordered">Serial Settings:Number of Bytes at Serial Port</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered">Serial Settings:Modem Line Settings:Line DCD State</td>
<td class="Bordered">Specifies the current state of the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) input signal. This is often used by modems to indicate the detection of a carrier (modem) on the phone line. This signal is also known as Receive Line Signal Detect (RLSD). This property is read only except when the Wire Mode property is set to RS232/DCE, or RS232/AUTO with the hardware currently in the DCE state. <a href="Serial_Instr_3FFF00AF.html">Details</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="Bordered">Serial Settings:Modem Line Settings:Break State</td>
<td class="Bordered">Sets manual control of the serial port's break state. If asserted, this property suspends character transmission and places the transmission line in a break state until this property is unasserted. If you want VISA to send a break signal after each write operation automatically, use the Break Length (Break Len) and End Mode for Writes (ASRL End Out) properties instead.
