<td><strong>Note</strong>ï¿½  Some PXI chassis, typically those with more than eight slots, have multiple trigger buses (also called segments). The PXI Backplane resource uses the VISA Map Trigger to map a trigger between two trigger buses. One trigger bus, specified by Source Trigger Bus Number, is the source or writer for this trigger line. The other trigger bus, specified by Destination Trigger Bus Number, is a reader. You can have multiple readers, but only one writer for a given trigger line. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">For example, if you want to have triggers mapped from trigger bus 1 to trigger bus 2 and then from trigger bus 2 to trigger bus 3. In this case trigger bus 1 is the writer for this line, writing to both trigger bus 2 and trigger bus 3. Therefore, you should perform VISA Map Trigger from 1 to 2 and from 1 to 3. Mapping from 1 to 2 and then 2 to 3 would not be allowed because it would require 2 to be a writer (as well as 1). Note also that mapping from one line in the source trigger bus to a different line in the destination trigger bus is dependent on hardware capabilities and a specific software implementation. This behavior might not be supported.</p>
<p class="Body">A value of -1 means this feature is not enabled or not applicable.  On a single-segment chassis (eight slots or less), this feature is not applicable.  For a multi-segment chassis (more than eight slots), the valid values are 1 to the number of chassis segments. You can determine the number of segments from MAX (in the trigger reservation panel), from the chassis documentation, and by looking at the dividing lines on the physical front panel of the chassis itself. The default is -1.</p>
