<p class="Body">
			
				To call a shared library with the <a href="../glang/Call_Library_Function.html">Call Library Function Node</a>, you must specify either the name of the shared library or the path to the shared library on disk. However, these two techniques produce different consequences when you distribute or relocate your VIs and applications. Use the following table to determine which technique addresses your particular use case.</p>
<table class="Bordered">

<tr>
<td class="Bordered">By name</td>
<td class="Bordered">The shared library is in the system search path. Common examples include system shared libraries, such as <span class="Monospace">kernel32.dll</span>, and third party shared libraries designed for componentized reuse.</td>

<p class="Body">To specify the location of a shared library, you can enter the name or path in the <strong>Library name or path</strong> text box of the <a href="../lvdialog/Call_Lib_Function_DB.html">Call Library Function</a> dialog box.

<td class="Dark-Red"><strong>Caution</strong>��Do not specify the location of a system shared library, such as <span class="Monospace">kernel32.dll</span>, by path. Because LabVIEW automatically includes by-path shared libraries in build specifications, you might distribute a system shared library to another computer inadvertently. Redistributing some shared libraries, such as <span class="Monospace">kernel32.dll</span>, might cause the target computer to crash. Therefore, always specify system shared libraries by name.</td>

</table><a name="by_name"></a><h2>Common Problems Loading a Shared Library by Name</h2>
<p class="Body">If LabVIEW cannot locate a shared library by name, consider the following possible causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To locate shared libraries that you specify by name, LabVIEW uses a modified version of the system search algorithm defined by your operating system. Refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_SEARCHDLL)">KnowledgeBase</a> at <span class="Monospace">ni.com</span> for more information about how LabVIEW modifies the search algorithm on specific platforms.</li>
<li>Specifying a shared library by name is not the same as specifying a relative path to a shared library within the same directory as the calling VI. To specify the latter, enter <span class="Monospace">./<em>shared library name</em></span> as the path to the shared library.</li>
</ul><a name="by_path"></a><h2>Common Problems Loading a Shared Library by Path</h2>
<p class="Body">If LabVIEW cannot locate a shared library by path, consider the following possible causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use a relative path to specify the location of the shared library, LabVIEW interprets the path relative to the location of the VI on disk.</li>
<li>If you use an absolute path to specify the location of the shared library, LabVIEW saves the relative location of the shared library rather than the absolute path. Therefore, if you change the location of the shared library relative to the VI, LabVIEW cannot locate the shared library and <a href="#missing_dlls">must search for it</a>.</li>
</ul><a name="missing_dlls"></a><h2>How LabVIEW Locates Missing Shared Libraries</h2>
<p class="Body">
					
		If LabVIEW cannot locate a shared library that you specified either by name or by path, LabVIEW searches the <a href="../lvdialog/Path_Options.html">VI search path</a> for the missing shared library. If LabVIEW finds the shared library, it updates the path to the shared library within the Call Library Function dialog box.</p>
<p class="Body">Searching for missing shared libraries requires extra time, displays an unavoidable search dialog box, and causes unsaved changes in the calling VI that you must save yourself. Therefore, configure VIs with the correct name or path information for shared libraries whenever possible.</p>
