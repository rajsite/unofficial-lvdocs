<h1>Additional Exclusions Page (Source Distribution Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">Use this page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Source_Distrib_DB.html">Source Distribution Properties</a> dialog box to configure settings to reduce the size of the source distribution, improve load time, and reduce memory usage when you load the resulting build. </p>

<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Disconnect type definitions</strong>&#8212;Specifies whether to omit type definitions from controls during the output of the build process. Selecting this option for an application with a large number of VIs can potentially reduce the memory usage of the build output.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused polymorphic VI instances</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused polymorphic VI instances during the build process. When you add an instance of a polymorphic VI to the block diagram of a VI you include in the build, LabVIEW adds all other instances of the polymorphic VI to the build. If you enable this checkbox, the Application Builder removes any polymorphic VI instances you do not call directly from the block diagram. You may want to disable this option if you dynamically load an instance of a polymorphic VI so the Application Builder does not exclude the polymorphic VI instance you dynamically load from the build. Disabling this checkbox may increase the size of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused members of project libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused project library members during the build process. If you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW only includes the VIs from the library you call directly from the block diagram. Enabling this option reduces the application size because LabVIEW does not include the other VIs referenced by the same project library unless the VIs are referenced by other VIs that are part of the build.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><p class="Body"><strong>Modify project library file after removing unused members</strong>&#8212;If you select to remove unused members of the project library, enable this checkbox to direct LabVIEW to modify the library so that the library file does not refer to the removed members. If you do not modify the project library, the application may take longer to build.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Disconnect unused inline subVIs</strong>&#8212;If you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW does not load any unused <a href="../lvconcepts/VI_Execution_Speed.html#SubVI_Overhead">inline subVIs</a> into memory when you load the resulting build, which improves load time and reduces memory usage. LabVIEW considers an inline subVI to be unused if VIs within the build only call the subVI statically via the subVI node. LabVIEW does not disconnect unused inline subVIs unless you disable debugging in the build specification on the <strong>Advanced</strong> page of the dialog box. You also must <a href="../lvhowto/removebd.html">remove the block diagrams</a> from unused inline subVIs; otherwise, LabVIEW does not disconnect them.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If an unused inline subVI is a member of a class, LabVIEW loads that subVI into memory when you load the build output even if you enable the <strong>Disconnect unused inline subVIs</strong> checkbox.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent packed libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW excludes copies of dependent packed project libraries to which you link from other build outputs. To exclude dependent packed project library files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original dependent packed project libraries instead of copying those files during the build. For example, if you create one build output and then a subsequent build output, you can relatively link the subsequent build output to a file in the first build output. If you leave this checkbox disabled, LabVIEW copies the dependent packed library file to which you linked instead of retaining the relative link to that file.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent shared libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, you limit the number of shared libraries LabVIEW copies. When you create one build output and then link to a file in that build output from another build output, LabVIEW traditionally copies the linked file. To limit the number of copied files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original files instead of copying the files during the build.

<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you move the original files to which multiple build outputs are linked, those outputs may not load correctly depending on the location to which you move the original files.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Exclude files from vi.lib</strong>&#8212;Excludes all files in the <span class="Monospace">vi.lib</span> directory from the source distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude files from instr.lib</strong>&#8212;Excludes all files in the <span class="Monospace">instr.lib</span> directory from the source distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude files from user.lib</strong>&#8212;Excludes all files in the <span class="Monospace">user.lib</span> directory from the source distribution. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW only excludes files in <span class="Monospace">vi.lib</span>, <span class="Monospace">instr.lib</span>, and <span class="Monospace">user.lib</span> if you do not select them as <strong>Always Included</strong> in the <strong>Source Files</strong> page of the <strong>Source Distribution Properties</strong> dialog box.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Options for compiled code</strong><ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Embed compiled code in all source files</strong>&#8212;By default, LabVIEW creates one file to contain the source code and object code for all the files you include in the source distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Separate  compiled code from all source files</strong>&#8212;<a href="../lvhowto/separate_compiled_code.html">Separates compiled code</a> from all the files you include in the source distribution.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not separate compiled code if you intend to load the VIs produced by the source distribution in the LabVIEW Run-Time Engine.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Use the compiled code setting as saved in each source file</strong>&#8212;Maintains the settings for each file in the source distribution. For example, if you include both source-only VIs and VIs that maintain compiled code in a source distribution, use this option to preserve the original settings of each VI.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Building Editable and Run-Time Source Distributions</h2>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Editable source distributions</strong>&#8212;Build this type of source distribution to package and send code for use in another LabVIEW development environment. The default options in LabVIEW primarily support this use case.  Because these source distributions are editable, LabVIEW leaves most of the components that provide optimization unchecked. If necessary, you can change the default components to provide more optimization.</li>
   <li><strong>Run-time source distributions</strong>&#8212;Build this type of source distribution to be a plugin which is loaded into a stand-alone application. Because you typically include a run-time source distribution in a stand-alone application, avoid editing the code for a source distribution with this use case. Configure run-time source distributions for optimization in order to reduce the output size on disk.</li>

If you do not remove the checkmark from this checkbox, the application loads and modifies the library that it shares with the source distribution. Furthermore, the library no longer contains references to the VIs in the source distribution and causes the VIs in the source distribution to break when loaded into the application.
                    <br><br>For example, if you want to include a source distribution that contains Mean VI within a stand-alone application that contains Median VI, and Mean VI and Median VI belong to the same project library, remove the checkmark from this checkbox when building the stand-alone application. Otherwise, the project library in the stand-alone application only contains a reference to Median VI after removing unused members and modifying the library file. When the stand-alone application loads the source distribution, Mean VI breaks upon load because the library within the stand-alone application no longer contains a reference to Mean VI.
