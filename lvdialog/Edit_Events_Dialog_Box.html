<h1>Edit Events Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">Right-click the <a href="../glang/Event_Structure.html">Event</a> structure and select <strong>Edit Events Handled by This Case</strong> from the shortcut menu to display this dialog box. You also can right-click the Event structure and select <strong>Add Event Case</strong> or <strong>Duplicate Event Case</strong> from the shortcut menu to display this dialog box.</p>
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to <a href="../lvhowto/CfgEvents.html">configure events</a>. Event handling in LabVIEW is different from handling events in other programming languages. <!--begin parent="../lvhowto/CfgEvents.html"-->Before you configure events for the Event structure, review the <a href="../lvhowto/CaveatsRecmndtnsEvnts.html">caveats and recommendations for using events</a> in LabVIEW.<!--end parent="../lvhowto/CfgEvents.html"--></p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Event case</strong>&#8212;Lists the number and name of all cases for the Event structure. You can select a case from this pull-down menu and edit the events for that case. When you switch to a different case, the Event structure on the block diagram updates to display the case you selected.</li>
<li><strong>Event Specifiers</strong>&#8212;Lists the event source and event name of all the events the current case of the Event structure handles. The <strong>Event Sources</strong> and <strong>Events</strong> sections of the dialog box highlight the event source and event name you select in <strong>Event Specifiers</strong>. Clicking an item in <strong>Event Sources</strong> or <strong>Events</strong> changes the highlighted item in the <strong>Event Specifiers</strong> section of the dialog box. Click the <strong>Add Event</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons to add or remove an event from this list.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Event Source</strong>&#8212;Lists the event source such as Application, VI, Dynamic, or Control.</li>
<li><strong>Event</strong>&#8212;Lists the event name of all events the current case of the Event structure handles.</li>
<li><strong>Add Event</strong>&#8212;Adds a new event for the current case to handle.</li>
<li><strong>Remove</strong>&#8212;Removes the selected event from the <strong>Event Specifiers</strong> list.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Event Sources</strong>&#8212;Lists the event sources, sorted by class, you can configure to generate events.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li> <strong>Event Sources Filter</strong>&#8212;Use the search box to show only event sources containing the text you enter.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&#8212;Lists the events available for the event source you select in the <strong>Event Source</strong> and <strong>Event</strong> section of the dialog box. <a href="../lvconcepts/Notify_and_Filter_Events.html">Notify events</a> have a green <img src="noloc_env_notifyglyph.gif"> glyph next to them, and <a href="../lvconcepts/Notify_and_Filter_Events.html">filter events</a> have a red <img src="noloc_env_filterglyph.gif"> glyph next to them. Refer to the <a href="../lvprop/event_source.html">Event Reference</a> topic for more information about available events.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li> <strong>Events Filter</strong>&#8212;Use the search box to show only events containing the text you enter.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Lock panel (defer processing of user actions) until the event case completes</strong>&#8212;<a href="../lvhowto/Lock_FP.html">Locks the front panel</a> when this event occurs, deferring processing of further user action until all Event structures finish handling this event. You can turn this option off for notify events but not for filter events. <BR><BR><table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="caution.gif"></td><td><span class="Dark-Red"><strong>Caution</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your Event structure is in a loop which executes often to ensure your user interface is responsive. If no Event structure executes promptly to handle an event and front panel locking is enabled, the user interface of the VI may become unresponsive.</span></td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Limit maximum instances of this event in event queue</strong>&#8212;Limits the number of times the event can occur in the event queue. If you specify to limit the instances of an event, the Event structure associated with the event queue handles only the number of events you specify and automatically discards older events as new events arrive.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Instances</strong>&#8212;Specifies how many instances of this event you want to keep in the event queue.</li></ul></li></ul>
