<h1>Configure Next Frame Timing Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System (Windows)</p>

<p class="Body">Double-click the Right Data node of a <a href="../glang/Timed_Loop.html">Timed Loop</a> or <a href="../glang/Timed_Sequence.html">Timed Sequence structure</a> frame to display this dialog box.</p>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right Data node of the last frame of a Timed Sequence structure does not include configuration options because you do not need to configure another frame or iteration.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to configure a start time, <a href="../lvconcepts/CON_Set_Priority_Timed_Structs.html">priority</a>, and other <a href="../lvconcepts/CON_Config_Adv_Timed_Seq_Set.html">advanced options</a> for the next frame of a timed structure.</p>
<p class="Body">Use the <a href="../lvdialog/Loop_Configuration_Frames_DB.html">Configure Timed Loop with Frames</a> and <a href="../lvdialog/Loop_Config_Next_Iteration_DB.html">Configure Next Iteration</a> dialog boxes to configure the initial execution and subsequent iterations of a Timed Loop with frames.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Next Frame Timing</strong>&#8212;Specifies timing options for the next frame. The <strong>Next Frame Timing</strong> settings include the following components.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Start</strong>&#8212;Specifies the time the next frame must start executing. Specify a start time value relative to the start time of the current frame in units of the frame timing source. The default is <span class="Monospace">-1</span>, which means the start time is unspecified for the next frame and executes immediately. If you set a value of <span class="Monospace">-1</span> for <strong>Start</strong>, the next frame can start immediately after the completion of the current frame if it has the highest priority of all other frames ready to execute.</li>
<li><strong>Priority</strong>&#8212;Specifies the priority of the execution of the next frame relative to other timed structures or frames that are ready to execute. The higher the number you enter, the higher the priority the next frame has over other timed structures or frames. The value for <strong>Priority</strong> must be <span class="Monospace">-1</span> or a positive integer between <span class="Monospace">1</span> and <span class="Monospace">65,535</span>. The default is <span class="Monospace">-1</span>, which means the priority is unchanged from the previous frame. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These priorities are different from VI priorities. LabVIEW executes the timed structures at a priority level below the time-critical priority and above the high priority. The LabVIEW execution system is preemptive, so a higher priority timed structure that is ready to execute preempts all lower priority structures also ready to execute and other LabVIEW code not running at time-critical priority.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Deadline</strong>&#8212;Specifies a time boundary for the completion of the next frame. The time is relative to the start time of the frame. The default is<span class="Monospace"> -1</span>, which means no deadline is specified for the next frame. The <strong>Finished Late? [f-1]</strong> output on the Left Data node of the frame after the next frame returns <span class="Monospace">TRUE</span> if the next frame does not complete before the specified <strong>Deadline</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Timeout (ms)</strong>&#8212;Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, the next frame can wait for a trigger event from the frame timing source. The timeout value is relative to the start time of the current frame. The default is <span class="Monospace">-1</span>, which means no timeout is specified for the next frame. If the frame does not begin to execute before the timeout value, the timed structure executes the frame and the rest of the iteration untimed and returns <span class="Monospace">Timeout</span> in the <strong>Wakeup Reason</strong> output on the Left Data node of the remaining frames.<br><br>
If the frame of a Timed Loop times out and no changes are made to the <strong>Offset</strong> or <strong>Period</strong> inputs on the Right Data node of the last frame, the Timed Loop waits on the next iteration at the same point where the original time out occurred for the same wake-up event.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Processor Assignment</strong>&#8212;Specifies the processor assigned to handle frame execution. The <strong>Processor Assignment</strong> settings include the following components.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Mode</strong>&#8212;Specifies how to assign available processors to handle execution. The default is <strong>Automatic</strong>, meaning LabVIEW automatically assigns a processor to handle execution. <ul>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong>&#8212;LabVIEW automatically assigns a processor to handle execution. LabVIEW disables the <strong>Processor</strong> control and sets it to <span class="monospace">-2</span> when you select this option.</li>
<li><strong>No Change</strong>&#8212;LabVIEW automatically assigns this frame to the processor that handled the previous frame execution. LabVIEW disables the <strong>Processor</strong> control and sets it to <span class="monospace">-1</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Manual</strong>&#8212;Allows you to manually select a processor to handle execution. You must enter a value between <span class="monospace">0</span> and <span class="monospace">255</span> in the <strong>Processor</strong> control to specify the processor you want to handle execution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Processor</strong>&#8212;Specifies the processor you want to handle execution. The default is <span class="monospace">-2</span>, which means LabVIEW automatically assigns a processor. To manually assign a processor, enter a number between <span class="monospace">0</span> and <span class="monospace">255</span>, where <span class="monospace">0</span> represents the first processor. If you enter a number that exceeds the number of available processors, you generate a run-time error and the timed structure does not execute.</li></ul></li></ul>
