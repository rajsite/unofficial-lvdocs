<h1>Source Files Page (Packed Library Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Application Builder <em>or</em> Professional System</p>

<p class="Body">Use this page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box to add and remove files and folders from the <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">packed project library</a> and to specify files to include in the build. </p>
<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Project Files</strong>&#8212;Displays a list of items under <strong>My Computer</strong> in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window. Select files from <strong>Project Files</strong> and click the arrow buttons next to the <strong>Top-level Library</strong> and <strong>Always Included</strong> listboxes to add or remove files from the listboxes.</li>
<li><strong>Top-level Library</strong>&#8212;Specifies the top-level project library of the packed library. You must define one project library as a top-level library. Click the arrow button next to the <strong>Top-level Library</strong> listbox to add a selected project library from the <strong>Project Files</strong> listbox. The packed library also includes the dependencies of the project library.</li>
<li><strong>Always Included</strong>&#8212;Specifies the dynamic VIs and support files to always include in the packed library. Click the arrow buttons next to the <strong>Always Included</strong> listbox to add or remove selected files from the <strong>Always Included</strong> listbox. When you add a folder to the listbox, you add all items in the folder and cannot remove individual items. You cannot move private data controls to the <strong>Always Included</strong> listbox.<br><br>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic VIs are VIs that LabVIEW dynamically calls through the VI Server. Support files are non-VI files, such as drivers, text files, help files, and .NET assemblies that the packed library uses. LabVIEW includes non-LabVIEW support files in a folder outside the library when you build the packed library. If you add a packed library to the <strong>Always Included</strong> listbox, LabVIEW also includes the packed library in the folder outside the library when you build.</td></tr></table></li></ul><br><br><br><p class="Body"><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><img class="center" src="back_arrow.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><em>Building and Distributing Applications</em> Home</a></p>
