<h1>Window Size Page (VI Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">From the front panel or block diagram window of a VI, select <strong>File&#0187;VI Properties</strong> and select <strong>Window Size</strong> from the <strong>Category</strong> pull-down menu to display this page.</p>
<p class="Body">Use this page to <a href="../lvhowto/Setting_Window_Options.html">customize the window size</a> for VIs.</p>
<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Panel Size</strong>&#8212;Sets the minimum size of the front panel. You cannot size the window smaller than one pixel in either dimension. If you set a pane to a size at which the scroll bars encroach on the content area's minimum size, LabVIEW hides the scroll bars. When you size the pane larger, the scroll bars appear again. If you allow the user to resize the window on the <a href="../lvdialog/Window_Properties.html">Window Appearance</a> page, the user cannot resize the front panel smaller than the width and height you set on this page. You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/VI_Minimum_Panel_Size.html">Front Panel Window:Minimum Size</a> property to set the minimum size programmatically.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;For single-pane front panels, minimum size refers to the content area of that pane, not including the scrollbars. For multi-pane front panels, minimum size refers to the entire front panel, including any visible scrollbars.</td></tr></table><ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Width</strong>&#8212;Sets the width (in pixels) of the minimum front panel size. You cannot size the window width smaller than one pixel.</li>
<li><strong>Height</strong>&#8212;Sets the height (in pixels) of the minimum front panel size. You cannot size the window height smaller than one pixel.</li>
<li><strong>Set to Current Pane Size</strong>&#8212;Sets the <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> to the dimensions of the current pane (in pixels).</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Maintain proportions of window for different monitor resolutions</strong>&#8212;Resizes the VI so it takes up approximately the same amount of screen space when opened on a computer with a different monitor resolution. Use this control in conjunction with scaling one or all the objects on the front panel. You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/VI_FP_WinKeep_Win_Props.html">Keep Window Proportions</a> property to maintain front panel window proportions relative to screen resolution programmatically.</li>
<li><strong>Scale all objects on front panel as the window resizes</strong>&#8212;Automatically resizes all front panel objects with respect to and in proportion to the size of the front panel window. Text does not resize because the font sizes are fixed. Use this option when you allow the user to resize the front panel window. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This option is disabled when you add a splitter bar to the front panel. You must configure the panes individually by right-clicking the pane and selecting <strong>Pane sizing&#0187;Scale all objects to pane</strong> from the shortcut menu.</td></tr></table>
You also can use the <a href="../lvprop/Pane_Set_FP_Scaling.html">Set Scaling Mode</a> method to read or set this option programmatically.</li></ul><p class="Body">Use the <a href="../lvdialog/window_run_time_position.html">Window Run-Time Position</a> page to set the position and size of a VI window.</p>
