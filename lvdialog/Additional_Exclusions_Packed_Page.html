<h1>Additional Exclusions Page (Packed Library Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Application Builder <em>or</em> Professional System</p>

<p class="Body">Use this page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Packed_Library_DB.html">Packed Library Properties</a> dialog box to configure settings to reduce the size of the <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">packed project library</a>.</p>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The options on this page do not apply to the <span class="Monospace">.lvlib</span> file you select as the <strong>Top-level Library</strong> on the <a href="../lvdialog/Source_Files_Packed_Page.html">Source Files</a> page because LabVIEW includes all files of the source <span class="Monospace">.lvlib</span> file in the build.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Disconnect type definitions</strong>&#8212; Specifies whether to omit type definitions from controls during the output of the build process. Selecting this option for an application with a large number of VIs can potentially reduce the memory usage of the built application.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused polymorphic VI instances</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused polymorphic VI instances during the build process. When you add an instance of a polymorphic VI to the block diagram of a VI you include in the build, LabVIEW adds all other instances of the polymorphic VI to the build. If you place a checkmark in this checkbox, LabVIEW removes any polymorphic VI instances you do not call directly from the block diagram. Disable this option if you dynamically load an instance of a polymorphic VI so LabVIEW does not exclude the polymorphic VI instance you dynamically load from the build. Removing the checkmark from this checkbox might increase the size of the packed library.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused members of project libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused project library members during the build process. If you place a checkmark in this checkbox, LabVIEW includes only the VIs from the library you call directly from the block diagram. Enabling this option reduces the size of the packed library because LabVIEW does not include the other VIs referenced by the same project library unless the VIs are referenced by other VIs that are part of the build.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><p class="Body"><strong>Modify project library file after removing unused members</strong>&#8212;If you select to remove unused members of the project library, place a checkmark in this checkbox to direct LabVIEW to modify the library so that the library file does not refer to the removed members. If you do not modify the project library, the packed library might take longer to build.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent packed libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW excludes copies of dependent packed project libraries to which you link from other build outputs. To exclude dependent packed project library files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original dependent packed project libraries instead of copying those files during the build. For example, if you create one build output and then a subsequent build output, you can relatively link the subsequent build output to a file in the first build output. If you leave this checkbox disabled, LabVIEW copies the dependent packed library file to which you linked instead of retaining the relative link to that file.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent shared libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, you limit the number of shared libraries LabVIEW copies. When you create one build output and then link to a file in that build output from another build output, LabVIEW traditionally copies the linked file. To limit the number of copied files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original files instead of copying the files during the build.
