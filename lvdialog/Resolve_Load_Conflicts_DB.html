<h1>Resolve Load Conflict Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">This dialog box appears when LabVIEW loads a file that requires dependencies that are conflicting items in the <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_LabVIEW_Projects.html">LabVIEW project</a>. A conflict is a potential cross-link that occurs when LabVIEW loads an item that has the same qualified name as an item already in the project.</p> 

<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to choose which dependent file to load.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Conflicting Items</strong>&#8212;Lists the paths and LabVIEW version of all items in the project and <strong>Dependencies</strong> that the file you attempt to load refers to. If an item matches the path expected by the loading file, a blue arrow appears next to that item.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Items might appear in <strong>Conflicting Items</strong> that LabVIEW cannot access because the path is missing or the item is in a different version of LabVIEW. You can select these items, but the items referencing them might load with errors.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong>&#8212;Opens the file dialog box and allows you to select an existing file to add to <strong>Conflicting Items</strong>. You can choose to load a VI from disk instead of from the items in <strong>Conflicting Items</strong>. If you load an item not currently in the project, LabVIEW adds the item under <strong>Dependencies</strong>. <strong>Browse</strong> is disabled when LabVIEW loads a conflicting item from a path the caller did not expect.</li>
<li><strong>Details for Selected Item</strong>&#8212;Displays information about the item you select in <strong>Conflicting Items</strong>. Details include the item icon, full path, creation date, and modification date. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other notifications appear depending on the item and situation. Notifications might state LabVIEW is unable to access the file on disk, a connector pane mismatch occurs between the selected item and the item trying to load, an item is from a version of LabVIEW that is unable to load, or the selected item matches the path expected by the item trying to load.  If LabVIEW cannot access the file, a question mark icon appears.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Load With Selected</strong>&#8212;Loads the item you select and closes the dialog box. LabVIEW updates the callers of this item to call this item as necessary.</li></ul>
