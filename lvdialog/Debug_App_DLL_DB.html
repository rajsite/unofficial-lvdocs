<h1>Debug Application or Shared Library Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">Select <strong>Operate&#0187;Debug Application or Shared Library</strong> to display this dialog box.</p>
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to select the stand-alone application or shared library you want to <a href="../lvhowto/Debug_Apps_DLLs.html">debug</a>. </p>
<p class="Body">You must enable debugging in the build specification before you build the application or shared library. Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button to start debugging.</p>
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you debug applications and shared libraries, you cannot debug reentrant panels that an Open VI Reference function creates or reentrant panels that are entry points to LabVIEW-built shared libraries. You also cannot debug subVIs within Diagram Disable structures. SubVIs within Diagram Disable structures appear as question marks while you debug an application. However, because code in a Diagram Disable structure does not execute, this does not affect debugging.</td></tr></table>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Machine name or IP address</strong>&#8212;Specifies the network location of the computer that is running the application or shared library. The default is localhost.</li>
<li><strong>Application or shared library</strong>&#8212;Specifies the applications and shared libraries available to debug. The ring control includes the names of all open stand-alone applications and shared libraries that were created with debugging enabled in the Application Builder. Click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to update the ring control with the latest information.</li>
<li><strong>Refresh</strong>&#8212;Updates the <strong>Application or shared library</strong> pull-down menu with the latest information about available applications and shared libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Connection status</strong>&#8212;Displays messages about the status of the connection to the application or shared library to debug.</li></ul>
