<h1>Save As Dialog Box (For Project Libraries)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">Right-click a <a href="../lvconcepts/Project_Libraries.html">LabVIEW project library</a> or an XControl in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window and select <strong>Save&#0187;Save As</strong> from the shortcut menu to display this dialog box. This dialog box appears only if you have already saved the project library or the XControl.</p>
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to save project libraries using various options. You can use this dialog box to save a copy of the previously saved file in memory to disk with a new name you choose. You also can rename the file.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes <a href="../lvdialog/Save_As.html">different components</a> if you are saving VIs.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components if you are saving a project library or an XControl:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Original file</strong>&#8212;Displays the path to the open file. You can use this field to determine the location of a file on disk.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong>&#8212;Creates and saves a copy of the file in memory to disk with a name you choose. If you enter a new file path or name for the file, the original file on disk is not overwritten or deleted. This option does not update referencing files outside of the original library in memory to refer to the new library.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Name for copy of library file</strong>&#8212;Enter a name for the new library file. LabVIEW automatically adds a <span class="Monospace">.lvlib</span> extension to the name of the library if you do not provide an extension. If the original file is in a library or project, you have the option of adding the new file to the same library or project by placing checkmarks in the appropriate checkboxes. If you place a checkmark in the checkbox to add the copy to the library, the checkbox to add the copy to the project is disabled and unchecked.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong>&#8212;Renames the file in memory with a new name you choose. This option closes and deletes the original file and opens the file with the new name, so only the new file exists on disk and in memory. If the original file is in a library or project, this option adds the new file to the same library or project, and removes the original file. Use this option if you want to change the name and/or location of the original file.</li>
<li><strong>Referencing files in the project or its dependencies</strong>&#8212;Lists files in memory that refer to the original file. This list appears only if the original file has referencing files in memory.</li>
<li><strong>Continue</strong>&#8212;Opens an additional file dialog in which you enter the name of the renamed file or the root path for the copy of the project library file and the contents of the project library.</li></ul>
