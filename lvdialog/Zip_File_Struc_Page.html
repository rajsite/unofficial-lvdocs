<h1>Zip File Structure Page (Zip File Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Application Builder <em>or</em> Professional System</p>

<p class="Body">Use this page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Zip_Properties_DB.html">Zip File Properties</a> dialog box to specify the file structure to use for the <a href="../lvhowto/develop_distribute_applications.html">zip file</a> build.</p>
<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong>&#8212;Specifies the file structure you want to use for the zip file build. The base zip directory is the top-level directory that contains all the files and folders when you unzip the zip file. You can select from the following options:<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Use common directory</strong>&#8212;Uses the lowest level directory that still contains all the files and folders you want to include in the zip file as the base directory. LabVIEW selects this option by default.</li>
<li><strong>Strip common directory</strong>&#8212;Uses the lowest level directory that still contains all the files and folders you want to include in the zip file as the base directory but does not include that directory in the zip file. Any files in the base directory appear on the same level as the immediate subdirectories of the base directory.</li>
<li><strong>Rename common directory</strong>&#8212;Uses the lowest level directory that still contains all the files and folders you want to include in the zip file as the base directory but renames the base directory using the name you enter in the <strong>Base zip directory name</strong> field.</li>
<li><strong>Base zip directory name</strong>&#8212;Sets the name LabVIEW uses for the base directory in the zip file. Select <strong>Rename common directory</strong> to enable this field.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Example of Selected Mode</strong>&#8212;Shows an example hierarchy of a zip file that uses the <strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong> you select and that includes the files in the <strong>Sample files</strong> fields. <table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This section does not show a preview of the zip file build. Select <strong>Preview</strong> from the <strong>Category</strong> list to see a preview of the zip file build.</td></tr></table><ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Sample files</strong>&#8212;Shows sample directory paths for files that appear in the <strong>Zip file structure</strong> example.<ul>

<li><strong>Sample path 1</strong>&#8212;Path to sample file <span class="Monospace">a.txt</span> in the <strong>Zip file structure</strong> example.</li>
<li><strong>Sample path 2</strong>&#8212;Path to sample file <span class="Monospace">b.txt</span> in the <strong>Zip file structure</strong> example.</li>
<li><strong>Sample path 3</strong>&#8212;Path to sample file <span class="Monospace">c.txt</span> in the <strong>Zip file structure</strong> example.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Zip file structure</strong>&#8212;Shows an example of the structure of a zip file. The example includes the sample paths in the <strong>Sample files</strong>. The example LabVIEW displays in <strong>Zip file structure</strong> depends on the <strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong> you select.<ul>

<li><strong>Zip file structure (use common)</strong>&#8212;Shows an example of a zip file that contains all files and folders. LabVIEW displays this example in <strong>Zip file structure</strong> when you select <strong>Use common directory</strong> as the <strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Zip file structure (strip common)</strong>&#8212;Shows an example of a zip file that contains all files and folders but does not include the directory. LabVIEW displays this example in <strong>Zip file structure</strong> when you select <strong>Strip common directory</strong> as the <strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Zip file structure (rename common)</strong>&#8212;Shows an example of a zip file that contains all files and folders with a different base directory name. LabVIEW displays this example in <strong>Zip file structure</strong> when you select <strong>Rename common directory</strong> as the <strong>Base Zip Directory Mode</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br><p class="Body"><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><img class="center" src="back_arrow.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><em>Building and Distributing Applications</em> Home</a></p>
