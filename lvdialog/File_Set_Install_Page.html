<br/><br/>
The folders in the <strong>Destination View</strong> directory that do not have a <span class="Monospace">LabVIEW</span> prefix correspond to Microsoft Installer (MSI) properties. Refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_MSDN)">Microsoft Developer Network website</a> at <span class="Monospace">msdn.microsoft.com</span> for more information about the corresponding Microsoft Installer (MSI) properties:

<ul><li><span class="Monospace">[All Users Desktop]</span>&#8212;Files you include in this folder install to the location that corresponds to the DesktopFolder property.</li>
<li><span class="Monospace">[Personal]</span>&#8212;Files you include in this folder install to the location that corresponds to the PersonalFolder property.</li>
<li><span class="Monospace">[Program Files Common]</span>&#8212;Files you include in this folder install to the location that corresponds to the CommonFilesFolder property or the CommonFiles64Folder property.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>File and Folder Attributes</strong>&#8212;Select from the following components to specify the attributes of the files and folders in the <strong>Destination View</strong>:<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Read-only</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in this checkbox to set the selected file in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree as read only.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in the checkbox to set the selected file in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree as hidden from users.</li>
<li><strong>System</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in the checkbox to set the selected file in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree as a system file.</li>
<li><strong>Vital</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in the checkbox to set the selected file in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree as vital for installation. If a file set as vital fails to install, the installation stops. Refer to the Microsoft Installer (MSI) File table help on the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_Microsoft)">Microsoft website</a> for more information about setting files as vital.</li>
<li><strong>Register COM</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in the checkbox to register the selected file in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree as a Component Object Model (COM) object. You can set this attribute only for files with a .EXE, .DLL, or .OCX suffix. If you include a stand-alone application in which you enabled the ActiveX server on the <a href="../lvdialog/App_Settings_Tab.html">Advanced</a> page of the <a href="../lvdialog/Build_App_or_DLL_DB.html">Application Properties</a> dialog box, set this attribute for the application file so the file is registered as an ActiveX server after installation.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>&#8212;Place a checkmark in the checkbox to unlock the selected file or folder. When you unlock a file or folder, you remove administrator access requirements from deployed files and folders, which allows anyone to edit files and folders after they have been installed. <BR><BR>This option is not available if one of the following conditions is true:
<ul>
<li>The selected file or folder is not locked.</li>
<li>The selected file or folder is locked but the current OS does not allow unlocking that file or folder.</li>
<li>	The selected folder is a predefined destination folder in the <strong>Destination View</strong> tree.</li>
