<h1>Additional Exclusions Page (Shared Library Properties Dialog Box)</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Application Builder <em>or</em> Professional System</p>

<p class="Body">Use this page of the <a href="../lvdialog/DLL_Settings_DB.html">Shared Library Properties</a> dialog box to configure settings to reduce the size of the shared library, improve load time, and reduce memory usage when you load the resulting build. </p>
<p class="Body">This page includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Disconnect type definitions</strong>&#8212;Specifies whether to omit type definitions from controls during the output of the build process. Selecting this option for an application with a large number of VIs can potentially reduce the memory usage of the build output.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused polymorphic VI instances</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused polymorphic VI instances during the build process. When you add an instance of a polymorphic VI to the block diagram of a VI you include in the build, LabVIEW adds all other instances of the polymorphic VI to the build. If you enable this checkbox, the Application Builder removes any polymorphic VI instances you do not call directly from the block diagram. You may want to disable this option if you dynamically load an instance of a polymorphic VI so the Application Builder does not exclude the polymorphic VI instance you dynamically load from the build. Disabling this checkbox may increase the size of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Remove unused members of project libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to remove unused project library members during the build process. If you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW only includes the VIs from the library you call directly from the block diagram. Enabling this option reduces the application size because LabVIEW does not include the other VIs referenced by the same project library unless the VIs are referenced by other VIs that are part of the build.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><p class="Body"><strong>Modify project library file after removing unused members</strong>&#8212;If you select to remove unused members of the project library, enable this checkbox to direct LabVIEW to modify the library so that the library file does not refer to the removed members. If you do not modify the project library, the application may take longer to build.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Disconnect unused inline subVIs</strong>&#8212;If you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW does not load any unused <a href="../lvconcepts/VI_Execution_Speed.html#SubVI_Overhead">inline subVIs</a> into memory when you load the resulting build, which improves load time and reduces memory usage. LabVIEW considers an inline subVI to be unused if VIs within the build only call the subVI statically via the subVI node. LabVIEW does not disconnect unused inline subVIs unless you disable debugging in the build specification on the <strong>Advanced</strong> page of the dialog box. You also must <a href="../lvhowto/removebd.html">remove the block diagrams</a> from unused inline subVIs; otherwise, LabVIEW does not disconnect them.
<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If an unused inline subVI is a member of a class, LabVIEW loads that subVI into memory when you load the build output even if you enable the <strong>Disconnect unused inline subVIs</strong> checkbox.</td></tr></table></li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent packed libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, LabVIEW excludes copies of dependent packed project libraries to which you link from other build outputs. To exclude dependent packed project library files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original dependent packed project libraries instead of copying those files during the build. For example, if you create one build output and then a subsequent build output, you can relatively link the subsequent build output to a file in the first build output. If you leave this checkbox disabled, LabVIEW copies the dependent packed library file to which you linked instead of retaining the relative link to that file.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude dependent shared libraries</strong>&#8212;Specifies to reduce the overall number of files in a build output. When you enable this checkbox, you limit the number of shared libraries LabVIEW copies. When you create one build output and then link to a file in that build output from another build output, LabVIEW traditionally copies the linked file. To limit the number of copied files, LabVIEW retains the links relative to the original files instead of copying the files during the build.

<table class="Borderless"><tr><td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td><td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you move the original files to which multiple build outputs are linked, those outputs may not load correctly depending on the location to which you move the original files.</td></tr></table></li></ul><br><br><br><p class="Body"><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><img class="center" src="back_arrow.gif" border="0"></a><a href="../lvconcepts/Building_and_Distributing_Applications.html"><em>Building and Distributing Applications</em> Home</a></p>
