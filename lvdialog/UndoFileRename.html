<h1>Undo File Rename? Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">This dialog box appears when you attempt to rename a file on disk that exists in an <a href="../lvconcepts/Using_LabVIEW_Projects.html">auto-populating folder</a>  in the LabVIEW project. This dialog box appears only if the file you attempt to rename is already open in LabVIEW or if the file has callers in the project. The project detects the rename on disk.</p>  
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to revert the rename.</p>
<p class="Body">This dialog box includes the following components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Undo File Renames</strong>&#8212;Reverts the rename on disk. If you click this button, you can use LabVIEW to rename the file by selecting <strong>File&#187;Save As</strong> in the <a href="../lvdialog/Project_Explorer_Window.html">Project Explorer</a> window.</li>
<li><strong>Accept As New File</strong>&#8212;Accepts the rename as a new file in the project. If there are callers to the original name, the original name continues to exist in the project even if the file is now missing. If the file is open in memory, saving the file recreates a file on disk with the original name.</li></ul>
