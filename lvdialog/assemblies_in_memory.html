<h1>.NET Assemblies in Memory Dialog Box</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> Base Development System</p>

<p class="Body">Select<strong> View&#0187;.NET Assemblies in Memory</strong> to display this dialog box.</p>
<p class="Body">Use this dialog box to view the identifying information for all .NET assemblies that LabVIEW has in memory. You can use this information to <a href="../lvhowto/debugging_assembly_calls.html">debug assembly calls</a> by verifying that LabVIEW is loading the correct assemblies for LabVIEW projects and VIs that use .NET objects.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Display assemblies in memory for <em>project</em></strong>&#8212;Specifies the project whose loaded assemblies appear in the assembly table.</li>
<li><strong>CLR Version</strong>&#8212;Indicates the version of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) that LabVIEW currently uses to load .NET assemblies. LabVIEW cannot load an assembly that targets a version of the CLR other than the version displayed in this field. To load a mixed-mode assembly that targets the CLR 2.0, you must <a href="../lvhowto/configuring_clr_version.html">configure LabVIEW to load .NET assemblies that target the CLR 2.0</a>.</li>
<li><strong>List of Assemblies</strong>&#8212;Lists identifying information for each assembly in memory that is referenced by the project you selected in the <strong>Display assemblies in memory for <em>project</em></strong> list. Use this information to verify that LabVIEW is loading the desired versions of your assemblies.<ul class="List-Hyphen">

<li><strong>Project</strong>&#8212;Indicates the project that loaded the associated assembly.</li>
<li><strong>Assembly Name</strong>&#8212;Specifies the name of an assembly that was loaded into memory by the selected project. <br/><br/>If the list of assemblies does not include the name of an assembly that you want LabVIEW to load into memory, verify the following items:
<ul>
<li>You selected the correct project.</li>
<li>The assembly is located somewhere within the <a href="../lvconcepts/net_defaults.html#search">search path LabVIEW uses to locate assemblies</a>.</li>
<li>The selected project calls the assembly that you want to load either with a .NET container or a Constructor Node.</li>
<li>If you expect the selected project to load the desired assembly indirectly, remove the checkmark from the <strong>Show only directly loaded assemblies</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Version</strong>&#8212;Indicates the version of the associated assembly. If the version number in this field does not match the version number of the assembly that you want LabVIEW to use, choose one of the following remedies:
<ul>
<li>Remove the displayed assembly from the <a href="../lvconcepts/net_defaults.html#search">assembly search path</a>.</li>
<li>Create a project configuration file to <a href="../lvhowto/net_specifying_assembly_version.html">force LabVIEW to load the desired version of the assembly</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Target CLR</strong>&#8212;Specifies the version of the CLR in which the associated assembly was compiled to run. If the <strong>Target CLR</strong> for an assembly does not match the <strong>CLR Version</strong> that LabVIEW is using, compatibility issues could arise. Refer to the documentation for the relevant assembly to see whether there are any known compatibility issues when using the assembly with later versions of the CLR.</li>
<li><strong>Path</strong>&#8212;Indicates the location on disk of the associated assembly. If the path of the assembly does not match the path of the assembly you want LabVIEW to load, remove the displayed assembly from the <a href="../lvconcepts/net_defaults.html#search">assembly search path</a>. This forces LabVIEW to locate another version of the assembly.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Show only directly loaded assemblies</strong>&#8212;Determines whether the <strong>List of Assemblies</strong> displays all assemblies in memory or only assemblies that are called from a front panel or block diagram within the selected project.</li></ul>
