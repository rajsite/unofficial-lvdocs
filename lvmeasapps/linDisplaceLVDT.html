<h1>Measuring Linear Displacement</h1>
        
        <p class="Body">Linear displacement is movement and direction along a single axis.  A position or linear displacement sensor is a device whose output signal represents the distance an object has traveled from a reference point.  The <a href="../measfunds/lvdts.html">linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)</a> is a sensor that measures linear displacement.</p>

<p class="Body">On M Series devices, C Series devices, and NI-TIO-based devices, you can use the counters to perform displacement measurements with <a href="../measfunds/twopulse.html">two-pulse encoders</a>. Linear position can be measured with two-pulse encoders.  You can choose to do either a  single point or a buffered sample clock displacement measurement.  </p>

<p class="Body">You also can measure velocity with two-pulse encoders, but you need to use a sample clock with a fixed frequency. To measure velocity, use the following formula: </p>

<p class="Indent1"><em>V = D/T</em></p>
<p class="Body">where <em>V</em> is the average velocity, <em>D</em> is the distance, and <em>T</em> is time. </p>

<p class="Body">The counter measures the position of the encoder using the A and B signals, which are offset by 90ï¿½.  The counter also supports the <a href="../measfunds/zindexing.html">Z index</a>, which provides a precise reference point and is available on some encoders.</p>
