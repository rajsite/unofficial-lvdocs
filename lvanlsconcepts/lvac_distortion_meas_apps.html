         <p> 
            		 You can make distortion measurements for many devices, such as A/D and D/A converters, audio processing devices, analog
            tape recorders, cellular phones, radios, televisions, stereos, and loudspeakers.
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Measurements of harmonics often provide a good indication of the cause of the nonlinearity of a system. For example, nonlinearities
            that are asymmetrical around zero produce mainly even harmonics. Nonlinearities symmetrical around zero produce mainly odd
            harmonics. You can use distortion measurements to diagnose faults such as bad solder joints, torn speaker cones, and incorrectly
            installed components.
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>However, in some cases you might want to use nonlinearities. For example, many musical sounds are produced specifically by
            driving a device into its nonlinear region.
