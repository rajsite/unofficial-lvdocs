            		 Ideally, a filter has a unit gain (0 dB) in the passband and a gain of zero (-&#8734; dB) in the stopband. However, real filters
            cannot fulfill all the criteria of an ideal filter. In practice, a finite transition band always exists between the passband
            and the stopband. In the transition band, the gain of the filter changes gradually from one (0 dB) in the passband to zero
            (-&#8734; dB) in the stopband. Practical filters might have passband ripple, and the stopband attenuation of the filter cannot be
            infinite. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>For most digital filters, you typically design the digital filter response in the frequency domain. The frequency response
            specification for the digital filter typically includes the target magnitude response, phase response, and the allowable deviation
            for each. The following figure illustrates the magnitude frequency response of a lowpass filter, which allows low frequencies
            to pass and attenuates high frequencies.

         <p>The frequency range from the passband edge frequency to the stopband edge frequency is the transition band, which has a frequency
            response that is unspecified. The filter passband and stopband can contain oscillations, which are known as ripples. A typical
            example of a ripple appears in the circle of the previous figure. <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> indicates the magnitude of the passband ripple, which equals the maximum deviation from the unity. <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> indicates the magnitude response of the stopband ripple, which equals the maximum deviation from zero. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Notice the transition band between the passband and stopband frequencies. In an ideal design, a digital filter has a target
            gain in the passband and a zero gain (-&#8734; dB) in the stopband. In a real implementation, a finite transition region between
            the passband and the stopband, which is known as the transition band, always exists. The gain of the filter in the transition
            band is unspecified. The gain usually changes gradually through the transition band from 1 (0 dB) in the passband to 0 (-&#8734;
            dB) in the stopband. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You can measure the passband ripple and stopband ripple in decibels, as shown in the following equations: 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>passband ripple = -20log<sub>10</sub>(1 - <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>p</em></sub>) 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>stopband ripple = -20log<sub>10</sub>(<em>&#948;</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>) 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Based on the two previous equations, you can convert the passband ripple to or from the decibel representation. For example,
            if passband ripple equals 0.01 dB, that is, 0.01 = -20log<sub>10</sub>(1 - <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>p</em></sub>), then <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.00115. Similarly, if stopband ripple equals 60 dB, that is 60 = -20log<sub>10</sub>(<em>&#948;</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>), then <em>&#948;</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = 0.001.

         <p>The following figure illustrates the magnitude frequency responses of a highpass filter, which passes high frequencies and
            attenuates low frequencies.
