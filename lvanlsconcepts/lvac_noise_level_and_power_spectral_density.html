            		 The measurement of noise levels depends on the bandwidth of the measurement. When looking at the noise floor of a power
            spectrum, you are looking at the narrowband noise level in each fast Fourier transform (FFT) bin. Therefore, the noise floor
            of a given power spectrum depends on the &#916;<em>f</em> of the spectrum, which is in turn controlled by the sampling rate and the number of points in the data set. In other words,
            the noise level at each frequency line is equivalent to the noise level obtained using a &#916;<em>f</em> Hz filter centered at that frequency line. Therefore, for a given sampling rate, doubling the number of data points acquired
            reduces the noise power that appears in each bin by 3 dB. Theoretically, discrete frequency components have zero bandwidth
            and therefore do not scale with the number of points or frequency range of the FFT. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>To compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare the peak power in the frequencies of interest to the broadband noise level.
            Compute the broadband noise level in V<sub>rms</sub><sup>2</sup> by summing all the power spectrum bins, excluding any peaks and the DC component, and dividing the sum by the equivalent
            noise bandwidth of the window. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Because of noise-level scaling with &#916;<em>f</em>, spectra for noise measurement often are displayed in a normalized format called power or amplitude spectral density. The
            power or amplitude spectral density normalizes the power or amplitude spectrum to the spectrum measured by a 1 Hz-wide square
            filter, a convention for noise-level measurements. The level at each frequency line is equivalent to the level obtained using
            a 1 Hz filter centered at that frequency line. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You can use the following equation to compute the power spectral density.

         <p>You can use the following equation to compute the amplitude spectral density.

         </div> 
         	 
         <p>The spectral density format is appropriate for random or noise signals. The spectral density format is not appropriate for
            discrete frequency components because discrete frequency components theoretically have zero bandwidth.
