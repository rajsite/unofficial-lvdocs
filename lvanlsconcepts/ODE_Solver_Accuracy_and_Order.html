         <p> 
            		 
            		 
            		 
            		 You can measure the error introduced into a differential equation solution per time step, which is known as the local error.
            You also can measure the maximum difference between the computed solution and the exact solution, which is known as the global
            error. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>The amount the error changes depends on the order of the ODE solver you use. If you reduce the step size of an ODE solver
            by a factor of &#955;, then the local error is reduced by approximately &#955;<sup><em>n</em> + 1</sup>, where <em>n</em> is the order of the ODE solver. Depending on the application, the global error might be reduced by approximately &#955;<em>n</em>. Reducing the error by any amount corresponds to improving the accuracy by the same amount. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>For a first-order ODE solver, if you apply the solver once with a step size of 0.1 and then apply the solver with a step size
            of 0.05, you might reduce the global error by approximately 2 times (&#955; = 2, <em>n</em> = 1). This reduction in error doubles the accuracy. If you use a second-order ODE solver under the same conditions, the second
            run might reduce the global error by approximately 4 times (&#955; = 2, <em>n</em> = 2). In this case, the reduction in error quadruples the accuracy of the simulation. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p> As these examples show, high-order ODE solvers usually are more accurate than low-order ODE solvers. In general, you can
            use fewer time steps and larger step sizes with a high-order ODE solver to get the accuracy you need. Using fewer time steps
            decreases the effects of round-off in the solution and potentially reduces the amount of time needed to compute the solution.
            
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>However, high-order ODE solvers typically require more computational resources, such as processing power and memory, per time
            step than low-order ODE solvers. If you have limited computational resources, consider using a low-order ODE solver and smaller
            step sizes.
