            		 In the digital domain, you cannot distinguish alias frequencies from the frequencies that actually lie between 0 and the
            Nyquist frequency. Even with a sampling frequency equal to twice the Nyquist frequency, pickup from stray signals, such as
            signals from power lines or local radio stations, can contain frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency. Frequency components
            of stray signals above the Nyquist frequency might alias into the desired frequency range of a test signal and cause erroneous
            results. Therefore, you need to remove alias frequencies from an analog signal before the signal reaches the A/D converter.
            
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Use an anti-aliasing analog lowpass filter before the A/D converter to remove alias frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency.
            A lowpass filter allows low frequencies to pass but attenuates high frequencies. By attenuating the frequencies higher than
            the Nyquist frequency, the anti-aliasing analog lowpass filter prevents the sampling of aliasing components. An anti-aliasing
            analog lowpass filter should exhibit a flat passband frequency response with a good high-frequency alias rejection and a fast
            roll-off in the transition band. Because you apply the anti-aliasing filter to the analog signal before it is converted to
            a digital signal, the anti-aliasing filter is an analog filter.

         <p>The following figure shows both an ideal anti-alias filter and a practical anti-alias filter. The following information applies
            to the following figure:

         <p>An ideal anti-alias filter, shown in part a of the previous figure, passes all the desired input frequencies and cuts off
            all the undesired frequencies. However, an ideal anti-alias filter is not physically realizable. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Part b of the previous figure shows actual anti-alias filter behavior. Practical anti-alias filters pass all frequencies less
            than <em>f</em><sub>1</sub> and cut off all frequencies greater than <em>f</em><sub>2</sub>. The region between <em>f</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>f</em><sub>2</sub> is the transition band, which contains a gradual attenuation of the input frequencies. Although you want to pass only signals
            with frequencies less than <em>f</em><sub>1</sub>, the signals in the transition band might cause aliasing. Therefore, in practice, use a sampling frequency greater than two
            times the highest frequency in the transition band. Using a sampling frequency greater than two times the highest frequency
            in the transition band means <em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> might be more than 2<em>f</em><sub>1</sub>.
