            		 The time-domain representation gives the amplitudes of the signal at the instants of time during which it was sampled.
            However, in many cases you need to know the frequency content of a signal rather than the amplitudes of the individual samples.
            
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>Fourier's theorem states that any waveform in the time domain can be represented by the weighted sum of sines and cosines.
            The same waveform then can be represented in the frequency domain as a pair of amplitude and phase values at each component
            frequency. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You can generate any waveform by adding sine waves, each with a particular amplitude and phase. The following figure shows
            the original waveform, labeled 
            		<cite>sum</cite>, and its component frequencies. The fundamental frequency is shown at the frequency <em>f</em><sub>0</sub>, the second harmonic at frequency 2<em>f</em><sub>0</sub>, and the third harmonic at frequency 3<em>f</em><sub>0</sub>.

         <p>In the frequency domain, you can separate conceptually the sine waves that add to form the complex time-domain signal. The
            previous figure shows single frequency components, which spread out in the time domain, as distinct impulses in the frequency
            domain. The amplitude of each frequency line is the amplitude of the time waveform for that frequency component. The representation
            of a signal in terms of its individual frequency components is the frequency-domain representation of the signal. The frequency-domain
            representation might provide more insight about the signal and the system from which it was generated. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>The samples of a signal obtained from a DAQ device constitute the time-domain representation of the signal. Some measurements,
            such as harmonic distortion, are difficult to quantify by inspecting the time waveform on an oscilloscope. When the same signal
            is displayed in the frequency domain by an FFT Analyzer, also known as a Dynamic Signal Analyzer, you easily can measure the
            harmonic frequencies and amplitudes.
