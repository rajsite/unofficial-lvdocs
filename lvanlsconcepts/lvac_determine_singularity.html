            		 Whereas the norm of the matrix provides a way to measure the magnitude of the matrix, the condition number of a matrix
            is a measure of how close the matrix is to being singular. The condition number of a square nonsingular matrix is defined
            as

         <div class="fignone">
            <div class="mathml-block"><span><img src="./2Flvac_determine_singularity.xml_d13631e36.png"></span></div>
         </div> 
         	 
         <p>where <em>p</em> can be one of the four norm types previously described. For example, to find the condition number of a matrix <em>A</em>, you can find the 2-norm of <em>A</em>, the 2-norm of the inverse of the matrix <em>A</em>, denoted by <em>A</em><sup>-1</sup>, and then multiply them together. The inverse of a square matrix <em>A</em> is a square matrix <em>B</em> such that <em>A</em><em>B</em> = <em>I</em>, where <em>I</em> is the identity matrix. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>For example, 
            	 
         </p> 
         <div class="fignone">
            <div class="mathml-block"><span><img src="./2Flvac_determine_singularity.xml_d13631e131.png"></span></div>
         </div> 
         	 
         <p>The condition number can vary between 1 and infinity. A matrix with a large condition number is nearly singular, while a matrix
            with a condition number close to 1 is far from being singular. The matrix <em>A</em> is nonsingular. However, consider the matrix 
            	 
         </p> 
         <div class="mathml-block"><span><img src="./2Flvac_determine_singularity.xml_d13631e269.png"></span></div> 
         	 
         <p>The condition number of this matrix is 47,168, and hence the matrix is close to being singular. A matrix is singular if its
            determinant is equal to zero. However, the determinant is not a good indicator for assessing how close a matrix is to being
            singular. For the matrix <em>B</em>, the determinant (0.0299) is nonzero. However, the large condition number indicates that the matrix is close to being singular.
            Remember that the condition number of a matrix is always greater than or equal to one; the latter being true for identity
            and permutation matrices. A permutation matrix is an identity matrix with some rows and columns exchanged. The condition number
            is a very useful quantity in assessing the accuracy of solutions to linear systems.
