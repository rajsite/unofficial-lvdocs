            		 You can use noise signals to perform frequency response measurements or to simulate certain processes. Several types of
            noise are typically used, namely uniform white noise, Gaussian white noise, and periodic random noise. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p> 
            		 The term white in the definition of noise refers to the frequency domain characteristic of noise. Ideal white noise has
            equal power per unit bandwidth, resulting in a flat power spectral density across the frequency range of interest. Thus, the
            power in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 110 Hz is the same as the power in the frequency range from 1,000 Hz to 1,010
            Hz. In practical measurements, achieving the flat power spectral density requires an infinite number of samples. Thus, when
            making measurements of white noise, the power spectra are usually averaged, with more number of averages resulting in a flatter
            power spectrum. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p> 
            		 The terms uniform and Gaussian refer to the probability density function (PDF) of the amplitudes of the time-domain samples
            of the noise. For uniform white noise, the PDF of the amplitudes of the time domain samples is uniform within the specified
            maximum and minimum levels. In other words, all amplitude values between some limits are equally likely or probable. Thermal
            noise produced in active components tends to be uniform white in distribution. The following figure shows the distribution
            of the samples of uniform white noise.

         <p> 
            		 For Gaussian white noise, the PDF of the amplitudes of the time domain samples is Gaussian. If uniform white noise is passed
            through a linear system, the resulting output is Gaussian white noise. The following figure shows the distribution of the
            samples of Gaussian white noise.

            		 Periodic random noise (PRN) is a summation of sinusoidal signals with the same amplitudes but with random phases. PRN consists
            of all sine waves with frequencies that can be represented with an integral number of cycles in the requested number of samples.
            Because PRN contains only integral-cycle sinusoids, you do not need to window PRN before performing spectral analysis. PRN
            is self-windowing and therefore has no spectral leakage. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>PRN does not have energy at all frequencies as white noise does but has energy only at discrete frequencies that correspond
            to harmonics of a fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency is equal to the sampling frequency divided by the number
            of samples. However, the level of noise at each of the discrete frequencies is the same. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You can use PRN to compute the frequency response of a linear system with one time record instead of averaging the frequency
            response over several time records, as you must for non-periodic random noise sources. The following figure shows the spectrum
            of PRN and the averaged spectra of white noise.
