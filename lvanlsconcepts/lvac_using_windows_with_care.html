            		 Window functions can be very useful to improve the speed of a measurement, but you must be careful. The Hanning window
            is a general window recommended in most cases. Use more advanced windows such as the LSL window only if you know the window
            will improve the measurement. For example, you can reduce significantly RMS measurement accuracy if the signal you want to
            measure is composed of many frequency components close to each other in the frequency domain. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You also must make sure that the window is scaled correctly or that you update scaling after applying the window. The most
            useful window functions are pre-scaled by their coherent gain—the mean value of the window function—so that the resulting
            mean value of the scaled window function is always 1.00. DC measurements do not need to be scaled when using a properly scaled
            window function. For RMS measurements, each window has a specific equivalent noise bandwidth that you must use to scale integrated
            RMS measurements. You must scale RMS measurements using windows by the reciprocal of the square root of the equivalent noise
            bandwidth.
