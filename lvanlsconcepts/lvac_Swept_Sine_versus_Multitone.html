            		 To characterize a system, you often must measure the response of the system at many different frequencies. You can use
            the following methods to measure the response of a system at many different frequencies:

         <p>A multitone signal has significant advantages over the swept sine and stepped sine approaches. For a given range of frequencies,
            the multitone approach can be much faster than the equivalent swept sine measurement, due mainly to settling time issues.
            For each sine tone in a stepped sine measurement, you must wait for the settling time of the system to end before starting
            the measurement. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>The settling time issue for a swept sine can be even more complex. If the system has low-frequency poles and/or zeros or high
            Q-resonances, the system might take a relatively long time to settle. For a multitone signal, you must wait only once for
            the settling time. A multitone signal containing one period of the lowest frequency—actually one period of the highest frequency
            resolution—is enough for the settling time. After the response to the multitone signal is acquired, the processing can be
            very fast. You can use a single fast Fourier transform (FFT) to measure many frequency points, amplitude and phase, simultaneously.
            
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>The swept sine approach is more appropriate than the multitone approach in certain situations. Each measured tone within a
            multitone signal is more sensitive to noise because the energy of each tone is lower than that in a single pure tone. For
            example, consider a single sine tone of amplitude 10 V peak and frequency 100 Hz. A multitone signal containing 10 tones,
            including the 100 Hz tone, might have a maximum amplitude of 10 V. However, the 100 Hz tone component has an amplitude somewhat
            less than 10 V. The lower amplitude of the 100 Hz tone component is due to the way that all the sine tones sum. Assuming the
            same level of noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 100 Hz component is better for the case of the swept sine approach.
            In the multitone approach, you can mitigate the reduced SNR by adjusting the amplitudes and phases of the tones, applying
            higher energy where needed, and applying lower energy at less critical frequencies. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>When viewing the response of a system to a multitone stimulus, any energy between FFT bins is due to noise or unit-under-test
            (UUT) induced distortion. The frequency resolution of the FFT is limited by the measurement time. If you want to measure a
            system at 1.000 kHz and 1.001 kHz, using two independent sine tones is the best approach. Using two independent sine tones,
            you can perform the measurement in a few milliseconds, while a multitone measurement requires at least one second. The difference
            in measurement speed is because you must wait long enough to obtain the required number of samples to achieve a frequency
            resolution of 1 Hz. Some applications, such as finding the resonant frequency of a crystal, combine a multitone measurement
            for coarse measurement and a narrow-range sweep for fine measurement.
