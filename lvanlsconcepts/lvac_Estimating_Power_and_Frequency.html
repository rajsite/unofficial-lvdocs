         <p> 
            		 If a frequency component is between two frequency lines, the frequency component appears as energy spread among adjacent
            frequency lines with reduced amplitude. The actual peak is between the two frequency lines. You can estimate the actual frequency
            of a discrete frequency component to a greater resolution than the &#8710;<em>f</em> given by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) by performing a weighted average of the frequencies around a detected peak in the
            power spectrum, as shown in the following equation.

            <div class="mathml-block"><span><img src="./imating_Power_and_Frequency.xml_d9045e23.png"></span></div>
         </div> 
         	 
         <p>where <em>j</em> is the array index of the apparent peak of the frequency of interest. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>The span <em>j</em> ± 3 is reasonable because it represents a spread wider than the main lobes of Rectangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman-Harris,
            Exact Blackman, Blackman, and Flat Top smoothing windows. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>You can estimate the power in V<sub>rms</sub><sup>2</sup> of a discrete peak frequency component by summing the power in the bins around the peak. In other words, you compute the
            area under the peak. You can use the following equation to estimate the power of a discrete peak frequency component. 
            	 
         </p> 
         <div class="fignone">
            <div class="mathml-block"><span><img src="./imating_Power_and_Frequency.xml_d9045e132.png"></span></div>
         </div> 
         	 
         <p>The previous equation is valid only for a spectrum made up of discrete frequency components. It is not valid for a continuous
            spectrum. Also, if two or more frequency peaks are within six lines of each other, they contribute to inflating the estimated
            powers and skewing the actual frequencies. You can reduce this effect by decreasing the number of lines spanned by the previous
            equation. If two peaks are within six lines of each other, it is likely that they are already interfering with one another
            because of spectral leakage. 
            	 
         </p> 
         	 
         <p>If you want the total power in a given frequency range, sum the power in each bin included in the frequency range and divide
            by the noise power bandwidth of the smoothing window.
