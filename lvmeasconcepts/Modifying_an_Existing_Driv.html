<p class="Body">You might want to modify an existing driver to optimize the code. In general, you should optimize only those VIs that are called repeatedly in a loop. Configuration VIs generally are called only once and have little effect on application speed.</p>
<p class="Body">Follow the <a href="../lvhowto/modification_instruct.html">Instrument Driver Modification Instructions</a> to modify an existing instrument driver.</p>
<p class="Body">If you need to modify only one or two VIs, consider renaming each VI by selecting <strong>File�Save As</strong> and selecting the <strong>Rename</strong> option in the <a href="../lvdialog/Save_As.html">Save As</a> dialog box. After you modify the name, you can modify the block diagram and front panel controls. Most changes to the block diagram should affect the <a href="../glang/String_Functions.html">String</a> functions.</p>
<p class="Body">If you need to modify several VIs and the existing driver is a project-style driver, consider creating a new driver using the existing driver as the starting point.  Select <strong>Tools�Instrumentation�Create Instrument Driver Project</strong> to launch the <a href="../lvdialog/IDproject.html">Create New Instrument Driver Project</a> wizard and create a new driver using the existing driver as the source.</p>
<p class="Body">If you intend to submit the modified driver to National Instruments for certification, refer to the <a href="javascript:WWW(WWW_DriverCert)">NI Developer Zone</a> for more information on Instrument Driver Certification.</p>
