<p class="Body">
				
				Many instruments are external to the computer and do not rely on a computer to take a measurement. By connecting instruments to a computer, you can control and monitor the instruments programmatically and collect data that you can process further or store in files. You can install some instruments in a computer similar to general-purpose DAQ devices. These internal instruments are called modular instruments.</p>
<p class="Body">Regardless of how you connect to an instrument, the computer must use a specific protocol to communicate with the instrument. How the computer controls the instrument and acquires data from the instrument depends on the type of the instrument. GPIB, serial port, and PXI are common types of instruments.</p>
<p class="Body">Like general-purpose DAQ devices, instruments digitize data, but they have a special purpose or are designed for a specific type of measurement. For standalone instruments, you generally cannot modify the software that processes the data and calculates the result because the software usually is built into the instrument.</p>
<p class="Body">Because modular instrumentation uses software running on standard PC technology, you can modify the behavior of these instruments more easily. For example, with some digital multimeter modular instruments, you can program the instruments to acquire a buffer of data at a high rate of speed, much like an oscilloscope.</p><a name="How_Computers_Control_Instruments"></a><h2>How Computers Control Instruments</h2>
<p class="Body">Computers control instruments by sending commands to the instruments over a bus, such as GPIB, PXI, or RS232. For example, you can send a command to the instrument to measure a signal and then send another command to send the resulting data over the bus back to the computer.</p><a name="Instrument_Drivers"></a><h2>Instrument Drivers</h2>
<p class="Body"><a href="What_is_a_LV_Inst_Drv.html">Instrument drivers</a> are not required to use an instrument, but can help save you time as you develop an application.</p>
<p class="Body">Using instrument drivers provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use instrument drivers to quickly build complete systems. Instrument drivers receive, parse, and scale the response strings from instruments into scaled data that you can use in test programs.</li>
<li>Instrument drivers can reduce software development costs because developers do not need to spend time understanding low-level command syntax needed to program instruments.</li>
<li>Instrument drivers can help make test programs easier to maintain because instrument drivers contain all the I/O for an instrument within one library, separate from other code, which is easy to upgrade when or if the hardware changes.</li>
</ul>
