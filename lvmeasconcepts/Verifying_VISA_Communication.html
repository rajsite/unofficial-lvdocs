<p class="Body">
				To verify that VISA and the device driver are installed correctly and VISA detects the instrument, first view the resource names that appear in the <strong>VISA resource name</strong> pull-down menu.  If no resource names appear in this list, VISA or the device driver might not be installed correctly. <span class="Platform">(Windows)</span> Use <a href="../lvmeasconcepts/Configuring_IO_Resources.html">Measurement &amp; Automation Explorer</a> to configure and test instrument communication.  If resource names appear in the <strong>VISA resource name</strong> pull-down menu, but a particular instrument does not appear in the list, you might have a cable connection problem.</p>
<p class="Body">If VISA is installed correctly and VISA detects the instrument, but you receive errors when you run the instrument control application, you must identify what sequence of VIs produces the error in LabVIEW.  If you are using an instrument driver, try to <a href="InteractivelyTestingCompVI.html">run each VI interactively</a> and verify that each control is set appropriately.</p>
<p class="Body">NI I/O Trace is a tool for monitoring instrument I/O communications while your application runs. You can use NI I/O Trace to capture instrument I/O calls and their results while LabVIEW VIs run. Capturing calls and their results can help you debug problems with instrument communications. Select <strong>Tools�Instrumentation�NI I/O Trace</strong> to launch NI I/O Trace. <span class="Platform">(Windows)</span> You also can select <strong>Start�All Programs�National Instruments�NI I/O Trace</strong> to launch NI I/O Trace. <span class="Platform">(Mac OS X)</span> You also can select <strong>Applications�National Instruments�NI I/O Trace</strong> and double-click the NI I/O Trace icon to launch NI I/O Trace. <span class="Platform">(Linux)</span> You also can type <span class="Monospace">niiotrace</span> in the command line to launch NI I/O Trace.</p>
