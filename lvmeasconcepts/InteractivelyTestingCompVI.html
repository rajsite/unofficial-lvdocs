				You might want to test <a href="Accessing_Inst_Driver_VIs.html">instrument driver VIs</a> interactively before you include them in an application. Testing instrument driver VIs helps to select appropriate instrument configuration settings. To run the driver VIs from their front panels, you must first run the Initialize VI. For subsequent VIs, you must first select the resource name from the <strong>VISA resource name</strong> pull-down menu.</p>
<p class="Body">After you have selected a resource, you can interactively run the driver VI from the front panel multiple times without resetting the resource selection.</p>
<p class="Body">In general, you should run the instrument driver VIs in the order you want to call them in the application. First you run the Initialize VI, followed by one or more configuration VIs. If you are using a trigger for the measurement, you might need to call an action VI to arm the trigger. Calls to data VIs then collect the measured value(s). When you are finished testing the instrument driver component VIs, you should run the Close VI to deallocate resources.</p>
